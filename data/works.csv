Since the niche of technical textiles is rapidly expanding and is the main field of innovation and research in textile and apparel industry, embroidery is found in a variety of new functional applications due to the unique opportunity of creating three-dimensional light-weight structures and laying threads on the base material in all directions. As the field of smart textiles is vast per se and is associated with technical textiles and wearable technologies, the main applications of the embroidery may be described accordingly as ones for technical applications. In the sphere of medical textiles, embroidery is a relatively new technique, but is successfully used for wound-dressing development and innovative solutions for tissue engineering due to the opportunity of creating three-dimensional structures from fine polymer materials. Another advantageous characteristic of goods developed by embroidery is dimensional stability of manufactured textile structures. Due to these particularities embroidery is used widely also for such technical applications as development of heating grids, shielding, conductive interconnections, intelligent textile sensors and interfaces etc. Moreover, a large variety of materials and threads can be used in prototyping by the technique, e.g., conductive threads, metal wires, laminated polymer and carbon fibers. One of the challenging sub-sectors of intelligent textiles and smart textiles for healthcare applications is the research and development of textile sensors for biometrics and measurement of physical parameters. Most of the mentioned biosensors are implemented by transferring the principles of conventional actuators to the textile structures.","[('Architectural engineering', 1, '0.40715984'), ('Computer science', 0, '0.332292'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.32608134')]"

A new type of knitted strain sensing elements (knitted resistive fabric (KRF)) which can be integrated in the smart garment was developed. KRF was produced from conductive resistive, nonconductive isolating and nonconductive elastomeric yarns. Elastomeric yarn was used as the base yarn and was knitted within the whole fabric, but isolating and resistive yarns (functional yarns) were used as face yarns and knitted in specific sequence. Electrical model of KRF is proposed to describe the behavior of sensing element. The developed KRF has high sensitivity to strain deformation and can be used as local strain sensor or distributed resistive sensing field to control deformation of human body parts, joint motion, respiration etc.","[('Resistive touchscreen', 2, '0.71209455'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.4672437'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.41811723'), ('Computer science', 0, '0.34688044'), ('Computer vision', 1, '0.13918218')]"

Cellulose is most valuable component of bast fibres with a wide application range. Relative content of crystalline cellulose influences mechanical properties of fibres. Content and structural composition of lignin determines how severe technologies could be applied to separate crystalline cellulose from matrix. The paper examines the flax and hemp fiber structure and chemical composition of the total comparative analysis, as well as determined and compared crystalline and amorphous cellulose composition of several Latvian and grown in Poland fiber flax and hemp fibers varieties. Both flax and hemp biological, physical, chemical and mechanical properties depend on various factors and their interactions: a variety of places of production and pre-culture, climate and agricultural complexes are harvested and selected initial treatment (fiber) type and parameters which creates problems for fiber with similar characteristics. Flax and hemp straw structure, layout and design of the filament are very similar. The fiber mechanical properties are directly dependent on the cellulose content of the fibers, the degree of polymerization, mikrofibrillic angle, initial treatment type and parameters. The total crystalline cellulose constituents of flax fibres are found varying in the range from 64.57 to 75.38 %, whiles in hemp fibers varying in range from 64.2 % to 70.5 %. In addition, the fiber contains hemicellulose (12.97 to 26.07 % flax, hemp, 16.99 to 23.79 %), lignin (4.78 to 7.44 % flax , hemp, 5.68 to 7.96 %) pectin (0.45 to 3.23 % flax, hemp, 1.37 to 1.64 %), fats and waxes (0.83 to 1.9 % flax, hemp, 0.52 to 0.73 %).

It is durable natural material which is biodegradable and its quality and aesthetics do not disappear during wearing. It is a luxury item and desirable in the fashion world. Although leather industry is confronted with many problems, consumer still demands this material or alike for this material in quality. This article gives an overview of leather industry and its problems and challenges, explores alternative leather industries like eel, salmon and poulard leathers, which are byproducts of other food industries. The article gives little introduction in laboratory grown hides from   Meadow   and includes deeper investigation in innovative materials from non-animal origin equivalent textile material creation, like   Pinatex   which is made from pineapple fiber,   Muskin   and   MycoWorks   vegan leathers, which are made on fungi bases. Theme is discussed in order to detect in the clothing industry attractive young innovative materials with big future. Such innovations open up opportunities for science, engineering and design collaboration and encourage designers for innovative sustainable creation. This article will serve as a base to draw attention of designers, engineers, biologists, chemists and other scientific professionals for possible collaboration to create future view on new material production. It can serve as a driving force for new product development in design clothing industry. The work as well draws attention to new consumer markets which is looking for non animal produced, sustainability, eco-friendly, circular cycle fashion. Work can serve as first steps for further research establishment to begin develop new materials. Result of the study can be used as information for interested audience.

In 2014and 2015 a database, where photos of jewellery, as well as information on jewellery and authors of jewellery is stored, which can be used in the Internet, was created. In the database information is stored in six basic groups: author, figures, and data on jewelry, artistically aesthetic appearance, materials used, and techniques. In the system altogether by 22 November 2016 763 photographs of jewellery, made by 116 authors of jewellery were stored. In the basic group “Artistically aesthetic appearance”, information is subdivided into subgroups – subject, composition, colour and volume. In the framework of this paper author analyses data that are accumulated from 2011 until 2015 in the database of jewellery in the subgroup “colour”. In the period from 2011 to 2015 in total 20 types of colors 480 times were registered. In this period, the colours that are most frequently used in jewellery are: silver – marked in 110 instances, white – 46, blue – 45, black – 43 and red color in 37 instances. In the making of jewellery also various brown tones are used. They are present because Latvian jewellery authors favour natural materials such as wood, seed, shells, moss. From statistical aspect in Latvian jewellery, achromatic colour tones such as grey, black and white tones are dominant. Among the chromatic colours, blue and red are the most popular. If colors in Latvian jewellery are studied not from the point of view of frequency of their usage, but from point of view of diversity of settings of chromatic colours, we can draw a conclusion that the authors are using colour triads in jewellery compositions – such as blue together with yellow and red, as well as green together with orange and violet. However, more frequently, only two colours from theses colour settings are used together. In the same way separately in jeweller, settings of cold colours or warm colours are used.      Krāsas un krāsu salikumi Latvijas rotās no 2011. līdz 2015. gadam.

The design also has a social accountability component, which is closely related to the values of society.
