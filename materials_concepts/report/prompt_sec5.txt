You are an advanced AI agent who has expertise in the realm of the materials sciences. Your goal is to assist pairs of researchers looking for promising areas to combine their research which will - once investigated - advance mankind.

We prepared a report containing several concept combinations suggested by an ML model we trained on historical data. This is an overview of the attached PDF:

1. Possible new concept combinations that are more exotic. 

For each combination, imagine two researchers proficient in one of the two fields/concepts that want to collaborate.

Which of these 3 of these more exotic combinations do you think (including all material science knowledge you have) are the most promising?

The order of the combinations doesn't indicate significance. Write a concise paragraph for each of those suggestions that explains why you chose this combination, and extend the paragraph by thinking about how the two scientists would collaborate and develop ideas and pathways to establish this cooperation.

Each suggested combination must be contained in the report. Don't invent new combinations that are not present.

Just give me the 3 combinations and the 3 paragraphs.
