A detailed analysis of the dielectric function DF for wurtzite InN as well as for In-rich InAIN alloys is presented. The experimental_data, covering the energy range from 0.72 up to 9.5 eV, were obtained by ellipsometric studies of an 1120 a-plane InN film and low carrier density 0001 c-plane films. Model calculations of the imaginary part of the DF around the band gap provide direct insight how to determine the energetic position of the Fermi energy from the experimental results. Then, taking into account both, band gap renormalization and Burstein-Moss shift, the values of the gaps at zero carrier density are calculated. The dependence of the InAIN band gap on the alloy composition is described by a bowing parameter of 4.0 eV. The a-plane film exhibits a characteristic optical anisotropy below 1 eV which is attributed to the polarization dependence of transition probabilities from the three valence bands at the point of the Brillouin zone into the conduction band. The splitting of 25 meV between the absorption edges for the two polarization directions can be well explained by a crystal field energy of 19 24 meV if a calculated spin-orbit energy of 13 5 meV is assumed. All results emphasize a band gap value of wurtzite InN of about 0.68 eV.

Very recently, a method of phase-selective recrystallization has been proposed to significantly increase the ductility of eutectic alloys. Different from the conventional methods, such as adding modifiers and severe plastic deformation, phase-selective recrystallization is a simple way to control the microstructures with selective recrystallization of the soft phase but refining the hard phase. In this paper, we reveal the microstructure evolution in the phase-selective recrystallization treatment of AlSi alloys. The results show that through phase-selective recrystallization, the microstructure of the eutectic Si phase with high degree of spheroidization and fine grains of the -Al matrix can be obtained. Simultaneously, the refined hard Si particles and the soft -Al grains brought the unusual tensile elongation of 24%, triple of that in as-cast state. Meanwhile, the ultimate tensile strength increased from 208 MPa to 291 MPa. The performance of AlSi alloy with phase-selective recrystallization is superior to all previous treatments and can be used to produce high performance AlSi alloy sheet with large scale.

Different crosslinking time intervals were investigated to improve the stability, with the 20-h-crosslinked mats showed enhanced water resistance, better stability, and increased cell viability. The crosslinked mats showed distinguished mass increase during both swelling and biodegradability tests, especially with the decrease of CaCO3 concentration.

The properties of n- and p-doped silicon nanocrystals obtained through ab initio calculations are reviewed here. The aim is the understanding of the effects induced by substitutional doping on the structural, electronic and optical properties of free-standing and matrix-embedded Si nanocrystals. The preferential positioning of the dopants and their effects on the structural properties with respect to the undoped case, as a function of the nanocrystals diameter and termination, are identified through total-energy considerations. The localization of the acceptor and donor related levels in the band gap of the Si nanocrystals, together with the impurity activation energy, are discussed as a function of the nanocrystals size. The dopant induced differences in the optical properties with respect to the undoped case are presented. Finally, the case of B and P co-doped nanocrystals is discussed showing that if carriers are perfectly compensated, the Si nanocrystals undergo a minor structural distortion around the impurities inducing a significant decrease of the impurities formation energies with respect to the single doped case. Due to co-doping, additional peaks are introduced in the absorption spectra, giving rise to a size-dependent red shift of the absorption spectra.","[('Nanocrystal', 2, '0.6092422'), ('Doping', 2, '0.5570016'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.5438644'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.34980989'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.20162788')]",S7159504,"B,P,Si"

The CPFEM with the identified parameters were applied to the analysis of virtual models with focus on the microstructural factors such as the angle of interphase boundary, the orientation of habit plane in the martensite phase, and the intensity of texture in the ultrafine-grained ferrite phase developed in the severely-deformed sample. The analysis results suggested the following influences of microstructural factors on the deformation behaviour. The formation of deformation bands in the ferrite phase depends on the configuration of the interphase boundary, the orientation of the habit plane in neighbouring martensite phase and the intensity of texture in the ferrite phase.

Dual-phase nanostructure model is an effective method to improve the plasticity of Mg alloys. Here, molecular dynamics simulation is performed to investigate the influence of stacking fault SF and amorphous boundary AB on the deformation mechanism of dual-phase crystal/amorphous nanostructure Mg alloys under tensile loading. The results show that with the increase of AB spacing, the plastic deformation mode of dual-phase nanostructure Mg alloys containingwith large SF spacing converts from the generation and growth of new grains in crystalline phase to the plastic deformation dominated by amorphous phase. When the AB spacing reaches a critical value, the plastic deformation of dual-phase nanostructure Mg alloys is completely provided by amorphous phase, and the crystalline phase hardly participates in plastic deformation. However, the results also indicate that when the SF spacing in the crystalline phase is relatively small, the crystalline phase still contributes to the plastic deformation of Mg alloys to a certain extent, even if the AB spacing is large.

Thin sulfonated polyether ether ketone films swell excessively in water. The extent of water-induced swelling is shown to be correlated with the optical anisotropy of the films, due to two distinct phenomena. Firstly, the optical anisotropy is directly related to the amount of water taken up from the surrounding ambient atmosphere, and thus to amount of water present in the material just prior to swelling. Secondly, the optical anisotropy corresponds to internal stresses in the film that affect the free energy of the film, and thus the potential of the film to swell. The anisotropy vanishes upon sorption of liquid water and returns when the water is desorbed. When the water is completely removed, the film changes from more or less colorless to an intense yellow color that can be attributed to molecular assembly of the aromatic rings in the polymer backbone. The color change is reversible and occurs immediately upon exposure to low humidity. For films prepared in the absence of water, the lack of hydration of the sulfonic acid groups affects the microphase separation behavior of the polymer. This is manifested by an apparent lower propensity to water-induced swelling. The possibility to affect the properties of sulfonated polymer films by varying the hydration state of the polymer during preparation can have important implications for applications of such films.","[('Ether', 2, '0.8277991'), ('Swelling', 2, '0.7891182'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.7196686'), ('Morphology (biology)', 2, '0.6643022'), ('Ketone', 2, '0.6576673'), ('Solid mechanics', 2, '0.6380978'), ('Polymer chemistry', 1, '0.48071268'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.40356663'), ('Polymer science', 1, '0.35579565'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.2711782'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.22224173'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.1205408'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0'), ('Biology', 0, '0.0'), ('Genetics', 1, '0.0')]",S26125866,

Laser forming is achieved by plastic deformation induced by thermal stresses resulting from rapid nonlinear thermal cycles. Unlike mechanical forming, the process requires no hard tooling or external forces and thus there is no spring-back effect. A number of mechanisms have been identified to explain the thermo-mechanical behaviour in laser forming, accounting for various part geometries, laser process conditions and many materials. Although these interactions of thermal and mechanical factors are not yet fully understood, with increased knowledge of the laser forming process, the process offers significant potential value to industry such as aerospace, shipbuilding, microelectronics, etc. Modelling of the laser forming process may help to provide a basis for determining the heating pattern required, therefore making application of laser forming feasible and profitable to industry.
