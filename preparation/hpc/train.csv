Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is an important photocatalytic material that exists as two main polymorphs, anatase and rutile. The presence of either or both of these phases impacts on the photocatalytic performance of the material. The present work reviews the anatase to rutile phase transformation. The synthesis and properties of anatase and rutile are examined, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamics of the phase transformation and the factors affecting its observation. A comprehensive analysis of the reported effects of dopants on the anatase to rutile phase transformation and the mechanisms by which these effects are brought about is presented in this review, yielding a plot of the cationic radius versus the valence characterised by a distinct boundary between inhibitors and promoters of the phase transformation. Further, the likely effects of dopant elements, including those for which experimental data are unavailable, on the phase transformation are deduced and presented on the basis of this analysis."

Liquid phase sintering LPS is a process for forming high performance, multiple-phase components from powders. It involves sintering under conditions where solid grains coexist with a wetting liquid. Many variants of LPS are applied to a wide range of engineering materials. Example applications for this technology are found in automobile engine connecting rods and high-speed metal cutting inserts. Scientific advances in understanding LPS began in the 1950s. The resulting quantitative process models are now embedded in computer simulations to enable predictions of the sintered component dimensions, microstructure, and properties. However, there are remaining areas in need of research attention. This LPS review, based on over 2,500 publications, outlines what happens when mixed powders are heated to the LPS temperature, with a focus on the densification and microstructure evolution events."

Lead zirconate titanate PZT based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being considered as potentially attractive alternatives tofor specific applications. In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structureproperty correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium titanate, alkali niobates ANbO3, etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already working in this area and also draw the attention of the others."

Some brittle epoxies can be toughened significantly by the addition of an elastomeric phase. A great deal of controversy still exists on the nature of the toughening mechanisms. In this work tensile dilatometry at constant displacement rates was used to determine whether voiding, crazing or shear banding are the deformation mechanisms. Diglycidyl ether-bisphenol A epoxies toughened by various levels of several types of carboxyl-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber were studied. The results indicate that at low strain rates the rubber particles simply enhance shear deformation. At sufficiently high strain rates the rubber particles cavitate and subsequently promote further shear deformation. No indication of crazing as an important toughening mechanism is found. No significant effect of rubber particle size or type can be ascertained."

Microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene DCPD healing agent and Grubbs' Ru catalyst are incorporated into an epoxy matrix to produce a polymer composite capable of self-healing. The fracture toughness and healing efficiency of this composite are measured using a tapered double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen. Both the virgin and healed fracture toughness depend strongly on the size and concentration of microcapsules added to the epoxy. Fracture of the neat epoxy is brittle, exhibiting a mirror fracture surface. Addition of DCPD-filled urea-formaldehyde UF microcapsules yields up to 127% increase in fracture toughness and induces a change in the fracture plane morphology to hackle markings. The fracture toughness of epoxy with embedded microcapsules is much greater than epoxy samples with similar concentrations of silica microspheres or solid UF polymer particles. The increased toughening associated with fluid-filled microcapsules is attributed to increased hackle markings as well as subsurface microcracking not observed for solid particle fillers. Overall the embedded microcapsules provide two independent effects: the increase in virgin fracture toughness from general toughening and the ability to self-heal the virgin fracture event."

This paper deals with ultra-high-strength monofilaments of linear polyethylene that are produced by solution spinning and subsequent hot drawing at. The influence of the draw ratio on the mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres was investigated. Some salient features of a polyethylene filament with a draw ratio of 31.7 are: tensile strength at break=3.0 GPa, Young's modulus=90 GPa and DSC-melting point at a scan speed of min1=145.5 C. The modulus was found to depend linearly on the draw ratio. The tensile strength tended, by contrast, to approach an upper limit at high draw ratios. Additional morphological and X-ray studies revealed an extremely good orientation of the macromolecules in the fibre direction of the highly drawn polyethylene monofilaments."

The role Of matrix ductility on the toughenability and toughening mechanism of elastomer-modified, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DGEBA-based epoxies is investigated. Matrix ductility is varied by using epoxide resins of varying epoxide monomer molecular weights. These epoxide resins are cured using 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulphone DDS and, in some cases, modified with 10 vol% carboxyl-terminated copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile CTBN. Fracture toughness values for the neat epoxies are found to be almost independent of the monomer molecular weight of the epoxide resin used. However, the fracture toughness of the elastomer-modified epoxies is found to be very dependent upon the epoxide monomer molecular weight. Tensile dilatometry indicates that the toughening mechanism, when present, is similar to the mechanism found for piperidine cured, elastomer-modified epoxies studied previously. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy techniques corroborate this finding."

The principal toughening mechanism of a substantially toughened, rubber-modified epoxy has again been shown to involve internal cavitation of the rubber particles and the subsequent formation of shear bands. Additional evidence supporting this sequence of events which provides a significant amount of toughness enhancement, is presented. However, in addition to this well-known mechanism, more subtle toughening mechanisms have been found in this work. Evidence for such mechanisms as crack deflection and particle bridging is shown under certain circumstances in rubber-modified epoxies. The occurrence of these toughening mechanisms appears to have a particle size dependence. Relatively large particles provide only a modest increase in fracture toughness by a particle bridging/crack deflection mechanism. In contrast, smaller particles provide a significant increase in toughness by cavitation-induced shear banding. A critical, minimum diameter for particles which act as bridging particles exists and this critical diameter appears to scale with the properties of the neat epoxy. Bimodal mixtures of epoxies containing small and large particles are also examined and no synergistic effects are observed."

A yield criterion, not previously compared with the actual macroscopic behaviour of polymers, is herein compared with the pressure-modified octahedral shear stress criterion earlier suggested by others. This new relation, which is a version of the von Mises criterion, accommodates differences in tensile and compressive yield strengths and accounts for any dependence of yielding on the hydrostatic component of the applied stress state."
