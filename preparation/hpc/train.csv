Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is an important photocatalytic material that exists as two main polymorphs, anatase and rutile. The presence of either or both of these phases impacts on the photocatalytic performance of the material. The present work reviews the anatase to rutile phase transformation. The synthesis and properties of anatase and rutile are examined, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamics of the phase transformation and the factors affecting its observation. A comprehensive analysis of the reported effects of dopants on the anatase to rutile phase transformation and the mechanisms by which these effects are brought about is presented in this review, yielding a plot of the cationic radius versus the valence characterised by a distinct boundary between inhibitors and promoters of the phase transformation. Further, the likely effects of dopant elements, including those for which experimental data are unavailable, on the phase transformation are deduced and presented on the basis of this analysis."

Liquid phase sintering LPS is a process for forming high performance, multiple-phase components from powders. It involves sintering under conditions where solid grains coexist with a wetting liquid. Many variants of LPS are applied to a wide range of engineering materials. Example applications for this technology are found in automobile engine connecting rods and high-speed metal cutting inserts. Scientific advances in understanding LPS began in the 1950s. The resulting quantitative process models are now embedded in computer simulations to enable predictions of the sintered component dimensions, microstructure, and properties. However, there are remaining areas in need of research attention. This LPS review, based on over 2,500 publications, outlines what happens when mixed powders are heated to the LPS temperature, with a focus on the densification and microstructure evolution events."

Lead zirconate titanate PZT based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being considered as potentially attractive alternatives tofor specific applications. In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structureproperty correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium titanate, alkali niobates ANbO3, etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already working in this area and also draw the attention of the others."

Some brittle epoxies can be toughened significantly by the addition of an elastomeric phase. A great deal of controversy still exists on the nature of the toughening mechanisms. In this work tensile dilatometry at constant displacement rates was used to determine whether voiding, crazing or shear banding are the deformation mechanisms. Diglycidyl ether-bisphenol A epoxies toughened by various levels of several types of carboxyl-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber were studied. The results indicate that at low strain rates the rubber particles simply enhance shear deformation. At sufficiently high strain rates the rubber particles cavitate and subsequently promote further shear deformation. No indication of crazing as an important toughening mechanism is found. No significant effect of rubber particle size or type can be ascertained."

Microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene DCPD healing agent and Grubbs' Ru catalyst are incorporated into an epoxy matrix to produce a polymer composite capable of self-healing. The fracture toughness and healing efficiency of this composite are measured using a tapered double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen. Both the virgin and healed fracture toughness depend strongly on the size and concentration of microcapsules added to the epoxy. Fracture of the neat epoxy is brittle, exhibiting a mirror fracture surface. Addition of DCPD-filled urea-formaldehyde UF microcapsules yields up to 127% increase in fracture toughness and induces a change in the fracture plane morphology to hackle markings. The fracture toughness of epoxy with embedded microcapsules is much greater than epoxy samples with similar concentrations of silica microspheres or solid UF polymer particles. The increased toughening associated with fluid-filled microcapsules is attributed to increased hackle markings as well as subsurface microcracking not observed for solid particle fillers. Overall the embedded microcapsules provide two independent effects: the increase in virgin fracture toughness from general toughening and the ability to self-heal the virgin fracture event."

This paper deals with ultra-high-strength monofilaments of linear polyethylene that are produced by solution spinning and subsequent hot drawing at. The influence of the draw ratio on the mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres was investigated. Some salient features of a polyethylene filament with a draw ratio of 31.7 are: tensile strength at break=3.0 GPa, Young's modulus=90 GPa and DSC-melting point at a scan speed of min1=145.5 C. The modulus was found to depend linearly on the draw ratio. The tensile strength tended, by contrast, to approach an upper limit at high draw ratios. Additional morphological and X-ray studies revealed an extremely good orientation of the macromolecules in the fibre direction of the highly drawn polyethylene monofilaments."

The role Of matrix ductility on the toughenability and toughening mechanism of elastomer-modified, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DGEBA-based epoxies is investigated. Matrix ductility is varied by using epoxide resins of varying epoxide monomer molecular weights. These epoxide resins are cured using 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulphone DDS and, in some cases, modified with 10 vol% carboxyl-terminated copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile CTBN. Fracture toughness values for the neat epoxies are found to be almost independent of the monomer molecular weight of the epoxide resin used. However, the fracture toughness of the elastomer-modified epoxies is found to be very dependent upon the epoxide monomer molecular weight. Tensile dilatometry indicates that the toughening mechanism, when present, is similar to the mechanism found for piperidine cured, elastomer-modified epoxies studied previously. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy techniques corroborate this finding."

The principal toughening mechanism of a substantially toughened, rubber-modified epoxy has again been shown to involve internal cavitation of the rubber particles and the subsequent formation of shear bands. Additional evidence supporting this sequence of events which provides a significant amount of toughness enhancement, is presented. However, in addition to this well-known mechanism, more subtle toughening mechanisms have been found in this work. Evidence for such mechanisms as crack deflection and particle bridging is shown under certain circumstances in rubber-modified epoxies. The occurrence of these toughening mechanisms appears to have a particle size dependence. Relatively large particles provide only a modest increase in fracture toughness by a particle bridging/crack deflection mechanism. In contrast, smaller particles provide a significant increase in toughness by cavitation-induced shear banding. A critical, minimum diameter for particles which act as bridging particles exists and this critical diameter appears to scale with the properties of the neat epoxy. Bimodal mixtures of epoxies containing small and large particles are also examined and no synergistic effects are observed."

Glass-ceramics are polycrystalline materials of fine microstructure that are produced by the controlled crystallisation devitrification of a glass. Numerous silicate based wastes, such as coal combustion ash, slag from steel production, fly ash and filter dusts from waste incinerators, mud from metal hydrometallurgy, different types of sludge as well as glass cullet or mixtures of them have been considered for the production of glass-ceramics. Developments of glass-ceramics from waste using different processing methods are described comprehensively in this review, covering R&D work carried out worldwide in the last 40 years. Properties and applications of the different glass-ceramics produced are discussed. The review reveals that considerable knowledge and expertise has been accumulated on the process of transformation of silicate waste into useful glass-ceramic products. These glass-ceramics are attractive as building materials for usage as construction and architectural components or for other specialised technical applications requiring a combination of suitable thermo-mechanical properties. Previous attempts to commercialise glass-ceramics from waste and to scale-up production for industrial exploitation are also discussed."

Due to the remarkable physical and mechanical properties of individual, perfect carbon nanotubes they are considered to be one of the most promising new reinforcements for structural composites. Their impressive electrical and thermal properties also suggest opportunities for multifunctional applications. In the context of inorganic matrix composites, researchers have particularly focussed onas toughening elements to overcome the intrinsic brittleness of the ceramic or glass material. Although there are now a number of studies published in the literature, these inorganic systems have received much less attention than CNT/polymer matrix composites. This paper reviews the current status of the research and development of CNT-loaded ceramic matrix composite CMC materials. It includes a summary of the key issues related to the optimisation of CNT-based composites, with particular reference to brittle matrices and provides an overview of the processing techniques developed to optimise dispersion quality, interfaces, and density. The properties of the various composite systems are discussed, with an emphasis on toughness; a comprehensive comparative summary is provided, together with a discussion of the possible toughening mechanism that may operate. Last, a range of potential applications are discussed, concluding with a discussion of the scope for future developments in the field."

Transient liquid phase TLP bonding is a relatively new bonding process that joins materials using an interlayer. On heating, the interlayer melts and the interlayer element or a constituent of an alloy interlayer diffuses into the substrate materials, causing isothermal solidification. The result of this process is a bond that has a higher melting point than the bonding temperature. This bonding process has found many applications, most notably the joining and repair of Ni-based superalloy components. This article reviews important aspects of TLP bonding, such as kinetics of the process, experimental details bonding time, interlayer thickness and format, and optimal bonding temperature, and advantages and disadvantages of the process. A wide range of materials that TLP bonding has been applied to is also presented. Partial transient liquid phase PTLP bonding is a variant of TLP bonding that is typically used to join ceramics. PTLP bonding requires an interlayer composed of multiple layers; the most common bond setup consists of a thick refractory core sandwiched by thin, lower-melting layers on each side. This article explains how the experimental details and bonding kinetics of PTLP bonding differ from TLP bonding. Also, a range of materials that have been joined by PTLP bonding is presented."

The present paper investigates the effect of adding silica nanoparticles to an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer in bulk and when used as the matrix of carbon- and glass-fibre reinforced composites. The formation of hybrid epoxy polymers, containing both silica nanoparticles and carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile CTBN rubber microparticles, is also discussed. The structure/property relationships are considered, with an emphasis on the toughness and the toughening mechanisms. The fracture energy of the bulk epoxy polymer was increased from 77 to 212J/m2 by the presence of 20wt% of silica nanoparticles. The observed toughening mechanisms that were operative were a plastic shear-yield bands, and b debonding of the matrix from the silica nanoparticles, followed by plastic void-growth of the epoxy. The largest increases in toughness observed were for the hybrid materials. Here a maximum fracture energy of 965J/m2 was measured for a hybrid epoxy polymer containing 9wt% and 15wt% of the rubber microparticles and silica nanoparticles, respectively. Most noteworthy was the observation that these increases in the toughness of the bulk polymers were found to be transferred to the fibre composites. Indeed, the interlaminar fracture energies for the fibre-composite materials were increased even further by a fibre-bridging toughening mechanism. The present work also extends an existing model to predict the toughening effect of the nanoparticles in a thermoset polymer. There was excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the epoxy containing the silica nanoparticles, and for epoxy polymers containing micrometre-sized glass particles. The latter, relatively large, glass particles were investigated to establish whether a nano-effect, with respect to increasing the toughness of the epoxy bulk polymers, did indeed exist."

Constant strain rate, constant velocity and Hopkinson Pressure Bar compression tests were carried out on AerMet 100 martensitic steel between and spanning strain rates from 0.01s1 to 4000s1. The results were used to generate a predictive flow stress model over the entire range of test conditions. The effect of initial austenite grain size on flow stress was found to follow the HallPetch relationship. This dependency was then removed through innovative heat treatments. The morphology of the flow stress curves were also dependent on mechanisms of microstructural evolution which were controlled by the test method, strain rate and temperature. Friction and adiabatic heating also had a major contribution. A novel method was proposed in order to define the flow stress, which was then used to determine the work hardening exponent of the ZenerHollomon equation. It was found that a deviation from the linear trend was observed in Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests and reasons were given. An artificial neural network approach was used to determine a more accurate predictive flow stress model which included the effects of test method, temperature, stain rate and initial austenite grain size.

In a typical fabrication process, an elastomer stamp is used to replicate microlenses. In this work, a method is presented to integrate moth-eye structures as an antireflective layer into a polydimethylsiloxane PDMS stamp containing a microlens array. The integration of these structures is done by a thermoforming process. Due to the integration of the moth-eye structures into the PDMS stamp, the optical performance of the replicated microlenses can be improved and no additional processing steps are necessary after the replication process."

The results showed that defectless FSPed specimen was obtained at the transverse speed of 100mm/min. Microstructural analysis was carried out by scanning electron microscope equipped with electron backscattered diffraction EBSD detector. It was found that by increasing the transverse speed, more significant grain refinement was observed in the stir zone. Furthermore, deformation induced martensite was not observed in the area subjected to FSP. Significant grain refinement resulted from dynamic recrystallization was found to be responsible for hindering formation of deformation induced martensite in the weldment section after tensile deformation test.

The concept is implemented using microbeads as the grinding medium to drive the shear friction between graphite nanocrystals in a high-concentration paste. The proposed approach substantially improves graphene yield from 6.3% to 100% and simultaneously generates a record productivity of 7.5 g h1 L1, achieving total graphite-to-graphene conversion on the kilogram scale.

Knowledge of the nonlinear elastic response and anharmonic properties of MgO single crystal is important for interpreting the seismically observed velocity variations in the Earths mantle and constructing reliable mineralogical modes of the Earths interior. However, investigations on these properties of it have not been performed sufficiently to date. So the nonlinear elastic response of the MgO is first studied by calculating the second-, third-, and fourth-order elastic constants. Results show that our predications on the high-order elastic constants exhibit excellent agreement with the available experimental ones and other theoretical values, which indicates that the present computational approach is suitable for the calculations of the high-order elastic constants and it can be expanded into other complex systems. Then on the basis of the elastic constants, the related anharmonic properties such as the first-order pressure derivatives of the second- and third-order elastic constants, Gruneisen constants of the long-wavelength acoustic modes, and ultrasonic nonlinear parameters are also investigated. The predications on the anharmonic properties first given in the present work are hoped to serve as a valuable guidance or reference for further related investigations."

Pure graphite, coke, and charcoal were used as the carbon material substrates. The reduction rates were evaluated by sampling at different reduction times and by analyzing the chemical compositions of the reduced slag and the produced metal. The carbothermic FeO reduction from slag is initially fast followed by a much slower reduction rate. However, the rate of the MnO reduction is slow in the fast FeO reduction stage, and it starts to increase significantly during the slow FeO reduction stage. The kinetics of FeO and MnO reduction are affected by the type of carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the rate of the carbon dissolution/transfer into the produced metal phase and the amount of the transferred manganese to the metal phase depend on the type of carbon. Based on the experimental observations and the thermodynamic calculations, a mechanism for MnO reduction was proposed. According to this mechanism, MnO is mainly reduced through a metallothermic reduction by Fe and the rate of MnO reduction is controlled by the rate of the consumption of FeO from the slag, which takes place simultaneously. In contrast, the rate of FeO reduction in the fast initial reduction stage is controlled by the rate of the carbon dissolution/transfer into the metal phase. However, at the second slow FeO reduction stage, it is reduced mainly by the solid carbon."

Initial residual compressive stresses between 20 and 65MPa result from the machining processes before T6 heat treatment. During the first temperature cycle the residual stresses in all materials change to tension at almost all Tmax. The peak value of the residual stresses reaches 50 up to 65MPa and is nearly independent from Tmax. Damage evolution was observed by light optical microscope and SEM after the same cycles as the residual stress measurements. Grain boundary reliefs arise and increase in all materials with increasing number of TF cycles and intergranular damage of EN AW-6061 and the matrix alloy of theis observed.

Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low density and for its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation and also it is known that the structural components of aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and structural materials. So, the most useful compound of aluminium, at least on a weight basis, is the oxides and sulfates. Therefore the selected composition of powder mix is compacted, with the resultant shapes heated or sintered in a controlled atmosphere furnace to bond the particles and then extruded. The tensile specimens which are prepared from extrudates are tested. The high precision formation capability of PM generates components with near net shape, intricate features and good dimensional precision pieces. The results were good at all the stages and this present study reveals the estimation of safe factor with respect to working stress and ultimate tensile stress."

This article presents how to link together the results of fatigue crack growth tests, analytic fracture mechanics and experimental methods of fatigue lifetime predictions. The study at the beginning investigates the effect of mechanical load redistribution among failed and intact micro-structural bonds along fatigue crack growth to final crack at vulnerable locations in materials and structures under cyclic loads. The microstructural load redistribution model is analytically formulated as a mechanical interaction between fatigue crack growth and fatigue endurance on the macroscopic level. The article in continuation investigates how to link the parameters of fatigue crack growth in fracture mechanics to parameters of fatigue life directly from the work done on crack growth determined by testing. The article at the end illustrates the application of the analytic procedure for fatigue lifetime prediction that combines fracture mechanics and the load redistribution model for determination of SN curve parameters important in structural analysis and design. In this research the fatigue life time parameters are derived from a single fatigue crack growth experiment instead from normally required sets of fatigue tests for different loading conditions."

Several materials have been used as surgical implants since the 16th century.

Until now two classes of metals namely stainless steel and cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys became known as materials for implant applications. They were considered suitable for surgical implant procedures but many researchers and surgeons were not completely satisfied with their performance. The main problem of the modern science is to find a material that perfectly restores tissues damaged after accidents or diseases. The trend of the current research in orthopedic prosthesis is based on the development of titanium alloys composed of non-toxic elements with low modulus of elasticity. Powder metallurgy techniques have beenused to produce controlled porous structures such as the porous coating applied for dental and orthopedic surgical implants which allows bone tissue grown within the implant surface, improving fixation.

Two nanogap cavities open inside the top and bottom gate oxides by the method of sacrificed layer etching. When the DNA biomolecule is introduced to the nanogap cavity, the hybridization event which is actually the formation of a double-strand of DNA will occur thus electrically modulating the GNR channel leading to a change in the drain current. The important report of this research is about attained high sensitivity of the proposed biosensor for a vast spectrum of the DNA biological samples. It is worth noting that a DNA sequence by 23 nucleotides extracted from Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be detected as a special case. An extensive numerical approach has been applied in order to characterize the proposed biosensor. The suggested biosensor has been evaluated by solving Schrodinger equation SE with Non-Equilibrium Green Function NEGF method in the mode-space coupled into Poisson solver in a self-consistent manner assuming ballistic limit. Two different expressions of sensitivity in terms of the threshold voltage and current have been defined giving a good metric for the sensitivity analysis. The results revealed a relative sensitivity of 1mV/nm2 by a filled area by the DNA about 120nm2 showing the excellent superiority for the proposed biosensor as compared to other counterparts. The effective area of the proposed biosensor obtains 240nm2 which is very small in comparison with other reports highlighting high capability of the biosensor in the detection. It has been shown that the proposed biosensor can be implemented in ultra-scaling domain resulting in considerable increase in the sensitivity promising a potent and reliable candidate for high-sensitive and small-size biosensors. Also, the technical issues on designing the suggested biosensor have been investigated to achieve a useful guideline in detection and identification of the target"

Applying insulation on individual HTS tapes is amenable to continuous manufacturing processes and opens up material choices for the insulation. In this study, heat shrink insulation was selected as the material choice for exploring the possibility of this design philosophy because of its commercial availability in multiple thicknesses. A systematic set of selection criteria was developed for the selection of appropriate heat shrink for given HTS tape dimensions. The cryogenic dielectric characteristics of insulated HTS tapes were evaluated both in liquid nitrogen and gaseous helium environments at. Dielectric characteristics of tapes with a single layer of thicker insulation were compared with those insulated using multiple layers of thinner insulation to evaluate the relative merits of each method. Several model power cables were fabricated using the PET insulated tapes, and their dielectric behavior was evaluated at in gaseous helium environment.

To perform this, six different configurations were used in the design of the dies channel for ECAP equal channel angular pressing to obtain nanostructure materials and to optimize the process. Thanks to simulation performed with FEM, it is possible to study the homogeneity in the deformation due to the variation of conditions affecting directly the material being processed using the ECAP technique, such as the friction coefficient, extrusion speed, and mainly the dies channel geometry being utilized in the ECAP process. Due to the tensile strain area being located mainly in the upper part of the deformed test cylinder plastic deformation area which increases the fracture and cracking tendency preventing the processing through ECAP the die being utilized was modified to eliminate the tensile strain area favoring the appearance of compressive stress which reduces the cracking tendency and the fracture of the sample being processed. The FEM analysis demonstrated that the strain state changed significantly from tension to compression when the modified die was used, facilitating the processing of the piece by ECAP."

Gemini amphiphiles have been widely investigated in many aspects due to the unique structure. In this study, two gemini-type Schiff base amphiphiles containing aromatic spacers were synthesized and characterized in Langmuir-Blodgett films. Both compounds formed stable multilayer films and showed distinct phase behaviours on water surface and ion subphase. When the compounds spread on Cu2+ ions subphase, an in-situ coordination occurred for both ligands. While spectral measurements confirmed the coordination with Cu2+ ions and aggregation mode, the morphological investigations showed the distinct nanostructures and molecular rearrangement depended on the molecular spacers and aggregation modes. For both process, the aromatic spacers in gemini amphiphiles have predominant effect in regulating the aggregation modes and spectral changes in organized molecular films."

Closed cell ZnAl27 hybrid foam was synthesized through stir casting technique using CaH20.5 wt% as foaming agent and cenosphere particles were used as thickening agent and to create microporosity into the final structure. The relative density of the synthesized hybrid foam was found in the range of 0.200.30. Microstructural characterization was carried out to find distribution of cenosphere particles into the cell wall of hybrid foam. Compression tests were carried out to find out the effect of temperature, relative density and strain rate on the deformation behavior of the foam. It was found that each foamed sample displays three regionse., linear elastic, plateau and densification respectively. On the basis of stress-strain curves obtained at varying relative density, strain rate and temperature the values of plateau stress, energy absorption capacity and densification strain were calculated. It was found that according to the increase in relative density and strain rate the plateau stress and energy absorption capacity also increased. The effect of temperature on plateau stress and energy absorption capacity for lower relative density was more as compared to the higher relative density. The densification strain was almost invariant 0.020.03 on varying strain rate for the same relative density."

Boron ion implantation into pre-amorphized silicon is studied. Pre-amorphization is performed either by F + or Si + implantation prior to B + implantation at 10keV with 310 15 ions/cm 2 . Broadening of the boron profile can be suppressed markedly in the pre-amorphized layers. For instance, the as-implanted depth at a B concentration of 110 18 atoms/cm 3 decreases from 0.19 to 0.1m for implantation into a pre-amorphized layer compared to B implantation into crystalline silicon. After annealing at, B atoms diffuse much more rapidly in the pre-amorphized layers than in the crystalline silicon case. Nevertheless, shallower junctions are obtained with the use of pre-amorphization. For dual F + and B + implantation at F + doses above 110 15 F + /cm 2 , fluorine is found to segregate to the peak of the boron profile during annealing. Fluorine is also trapped at the peak of the as-implanted fluorine profile peak and near the amorphouscrystalline interface. The effects of fluorine dose and anneal temperature on the F precipitation are described and compared to results for BF + 2 implants."
