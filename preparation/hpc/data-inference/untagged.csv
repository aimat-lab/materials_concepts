In this work, structural transformation, elastic behaviors, phonon spectra, and thermodynamic properties upon hydrostatic compression of hafnium are investigated by using first-principle density functional theory. Our calculated equilibrium structural parameters and the transition pressures of are well consistent with experiments. At ambient pressure, the elastic constants indicate that the and phases are mechanically stable while the phase is unstable. The thermal properties including bulk modulus, entropy, and heat capacity in wide range of pressure and temperature for -Hf are predicted. We present results of the phonon spectra and phonon density of states for the three experimentally observed phases and discuss the effects of pressure and temperature on those properties. The -Hf is mechanically and dynamically stable at high pressure or at high temperature. Employing the quasiharmonic approximation as well as the Debye model, we calculate the Gibbs free energy and predict the pressure-temperature phase diagram.","[('Phonon', 2, '0.7717427'), ('Hafnium', 3, '0.7383109'), ('Ab initio quantum chemistry methods', 3, '0.54460865'), ('Phase transition', 2, '0.5248825'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.49500507'), ('Elasticity (physics)', 2, '0.47347322'), ('Spectral line', 2, '0.4723576'), ('Thermodynamics', 1, '0.42804474'), ('Condensed matter physics', 1, '0.41246104'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.3141467'), ('Physics', 0, '0.15661752'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.101533026'), ('Molecule', 2, '0.073524326'), ('Zirconium', 2, '0.0'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Astronomy', 1, '0.0')]",S26018076,Hf

There is a lack of information with regards to the friction effect in ECAPed aluminum alloys, even though it might substantially modify the deformation at the surface. In this work, the friction effect at the surface and the deformation heterogeneity in the ECAPed aluminum alloy 6061-T6 were characterized. X-Ray diffraction was used to determine residual stresses RS on the sample surface. The volumetric sections were characterized by Synchrotron diffraction at ESRF beamline ID15B Grenoble, France. It was found that the microhardness mapping and residual stress results showed a good agreement with the finite element analysis for the first layer studied. Minor strain variation, Delta d/d as a function of hkl planes, for the different analyzed sections was found. The study also showed that there was an incomplete symmetry in the residual stress near the surface, even at up to a depth of 400 gm. The regions with higher deformation were found to be at the top and bottom parts of the sample, while the central region showed stress variations of up to 50 MPa. C2016 Elsevier B.V.

For the most part, the study of dendritic crystal growth has focused on continuum models featuring surface energies that yield six pointed dendrites. In such models, the growth shape is a function of the surface energy anisotropy, and recent work has shown that considering a broader class of anisotropies yields a correspondingly richer set of growth morphologies. Motivated by this work, we generalize nanoscale models of dendritic growth based on kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. In particular, we examine the effects of extending the truncation radius for atomic interactions in a bond-counting model. This is done by calculating the model's corresponding surface energy and equilibrium shape, as well as by running KMC simulations to obtain nanodendritic growth shapes. Additionally, we compare the effects of extending the interaction radius in bond-counting models to that of extending the number of terms retained in the cubic harmonic expansion of surface energy anisotropy in the context of continuum models.","[('Kinetic Monte Carlo', 3, '0.8348605'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.83251077'), ('Monte Carlo method', 2, '0.6548647'), ('Kinetic energy', 2, '0.62672365'), ('Statistical physics', 1, '0.5491028'), ('Classical mechanics', 1, '0.10447696'), ('Physics', 0, '0.081801206'), ('Statistics', 1, '0.06844002'), ('Mathematics', 0, '0.05896476')]",S117777245,

It was found that, besides the strong preferential oxidation of Zr in both alloys, the lack of structural order in the amorphous Cu33at.%Zr67at.% alloy results in much slower oxidation kinetics, as well as in distinctly different microstructures of the oxide overgrowth and its Zr-depletion zone in the wake of the ZrO2 overlayer growth front.

Alumina toughened zirconia ATZ, aluminum Al and titanium Ti particulate fillers were added to carbon fiber-reinforced polycarbonate composites PCCF at the percolation threshold 20 vol.% to form a hybrid composite with multi-dimensional fillers. Experiments indicate that the storage modulus and yield strength were increased by a maximum of 148% and 8%, respectively. In contrast, mechanical properties of the composite deteriorated when additional 1-dimensional 1D chopped carbon fibers were incorporated in any amount. Using the HashinShtrikman and Suquet analysis to remove the influence of filler material property, it was shown that the stiffening and strengthening occurred because 0D particles could be dispersed in the interstitial sites of the PCCF composite more easily than 1D fibers without causing significant agglomeration. Theoretical predictions from previous studies and electrical conductivity measurements support this premise. Employment of this novel strategy produced polycarbonate hybrid composites with specific strengths exceeding that of magnesium alloys, steel and some aluminum alloy grades, as well as combinations of strength and density not found in current engineering materials.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.94015026'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.85920405'), ('Polycarbonate', 2, '0.6463087'), ('Composite number', 2, '0.6433312'), ('Particle (ecology)', 2, '0.47970006'), ('Fiber', 2, '0.45248443'), ('Modulus', 2, '0.43810004'), ('Percolation threshold', 3, '0.41494283'), ('Electrical resistivity and conductivity', 2, '0.23714864'), ('Oceanography', 1, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0'), ('Electrical engineering', 1, '0.0'), ('Geology', 0, '0.0')]",S26125866,"Al,PCCF,Ti"

In this paper, we present the use of real time process monitors to study hydrogen induced phase transition from hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-Si:H to hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon c-Si:H films. We determine the H bonding configurations and H concentration in the film using a real time, high sensitivity infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine whether the film is amorphous or crystalline, and to measure the film thickness. The SiH bonding and film microstructure are monitored in three sets of experiments: during deposition of c-Si:H using DC reactive magnetron sputtering; exposure of unhydrogenated amorphous silicon a-Si to atomic hydrogen; exposure of a-Si to hydrogen plasma. In the first experiment, a transition layer of a-Si:H is deposited before c-Si:H growth starts. Results show no evidence of enhanced etching during c-Si:H growth compared to a-Si:H deposition under same processing conditions. In the second experiment, hydrogen coverage of the a-Si:H surface drops at higher temperatures due to thermal desorption. Lastly, when exposed to hydrogen plasma a-Si film is first hydrogenated, and then it transforms to microcrystalline phase with a concomitant decrease in H content. Based on these results, we conclude that the role of H is to assist in the nucleation of c-Si phase and provide enough surface coverage to facilitate the diffusion of surface species.

In each case the specimens are machined as thin-walled tubes that are deformed dynamically in a torsional Kolsky bar torsional split Hopkinson bar. Shear band initiation and formation are observed by ultrahigh-speed photography of a fine grid pattern deposited on the specimen's surface. It is shown that the critical strain for shear band initiation depends on the magnitude of a preexisting defect, in accordance with the predictions of Molinari and Clifton, J. Appl. Mech., 54 1991 806812. Ultrahigh-speed photographs of the grid pattern show that local strains of 1001000% may be attained and that the local strain rates reach 10 5 s 1 . In addition, the local temperature in the shear band is measured by employing an array of small high-speed infrared detectors that provide a plot of temperature as a function of time and position. Within the shear band region, temperatures of have been measured.","[('Adiabatic shear band', 3, '0.9429398'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.7802036'), ('Shear (geology)', 2, '0.6586139'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.6008653'), ('Shear band', 3, '0.50842637'), ('Martensite', 3, '0.48419026'), ('Adiabatic process', 2, '0.47301462'), ('Optics', 1, '0.37475294'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.354384'), ('Microstructure', 2, '0.28623492'), ('Physics', 0, '0.080830485'), ('Thermodynamics', 1, '0.075475246')]",S154732359,HY

The / microstructure becomes rafted and topological inverted eventually as creep deformation continues. The formation of dense interfacial dislocation network that impedes dislocations from cutting into precipitates is assumed to be one of the main strengthening mechanisms during creep.

The cutting through rafted precipitates is proposed to account for the acceleration of creep, a strong dependence of creep properties on rafting the effect of widening horizontal channel on the degraded back stress of cutting through rafted precipitates then arises.

The most promising solid electrolytes available to date consist of poly-ethylene-oxide PEO complexes doped with a lithium salt such as lithium perchlorate LiClO4 or lithium iodide LiI. At room temperature, the transport of lithium ions through these electrolytes is believed to occur by a hopping mechanism whereby, under the action of an electric eld, ions jump along coordination sites available throughout the polymeric chains. Under moderate electric eld intensities this mechanism results in a weakly nonlinear relation between the current density of electric charge and the electric eld intensity which for most practical purposes can be approximated by a linear relation. Above a certain eld intensity, however, a sudden increase of electric current is observed and the response becomes strongly nonlinear. The range of electric eld intensities delimited by this threshold is known as the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte and bears relevance to battery design for it dictates the electrochemical compatibility between electrodes and the electrolyte. Now, this window can vary consirably with microstructural properties such as crystallinity and second-phase inclusions. The purpose of this work is to put forward a multi-scale approach to estimate such variations. To that end, we consider the transport of multiple ionic species by diffusion and migration through microstructured solid electrolytes in the presence of strong electric elds. The assumed constitutive relations for the constituent phases follow from convex energy and dissipation potentials which guarantee thermodynamic consistency. The effective response is heuristically deduced from a multi-scale convergence analysis of the relevant eld equations. The resulting homogenized response involves an effective dissipation potential per species. Each potential is mathematically akin to that of a standard nonlinear heterogeneous conductor. A linearcomparison homogenization technique is then used to generate multi-scale estimates for these nonlinear potentials in terms of available estimates for corresponding linear conductors. By way of example, use is made of the Maxwell-Garnett and Effective-Medium linear approximations to generate estimates for two-phase systems with power-law dissipation. Explicit formulas are given for some limiting cases. In the case of threshold-type behavior, the estimates exhibit non-analytical dilute limits and seem to be consistent with elds localized in low energy paths. The estimates should be relevant for assessing the electrochemical stability of microstructured solid electrolytes.","[('Electrolyte', 3, '0.71888566'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.69755095'), ('Chemical physics', 1, '0.5375241'), ('Ionic bonding', 3, '0.5353288'), ('Ion', 2, '0.5330908'), ('Electric field', 2, '0.48748374'), ('Electrochemistry', 3, '0.486737'), ('Fast ion conductor', 4, '0.4862727'), ('Nonlinear system', 2, '0.46479887'), ('Ionic conductivity', 4, '0.43398547'), ('Electrode', 2, '0.34654194'), ('Physics', 0, '0.18741557'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.12921417'), ('Physical chemistry', 1, '0.10466251'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.0')]",S117777245,"LiClO4,LiI"

A PF-DDRX model containing second-phase particles SP was developed. DRX nucleation around particles is considered in the PF-DDRX-SP model. The microstructure and stress response contributed by SP is well predicted. DRX behavior depending on the dispersion of precipitates is notable. Pre-existing second phase particles can induce particle stimulated nucleation PSN and pinning effect on grain boundaries during DRX process of magnesium alloys. The interaction among pinning effect, PSN mechanism and strain-induced grain boundary migration SIBM nucleation mechanism imposes challenge in quantitative study of microstructure evolution. A phase field model that describes discontinuous dynamic recrystallization process considering second phase particles PF-DDRX-SP which mainly distribute along grain boundaries is developed. The second phase order parameter with diffusion interface is introduced to the free energy function. With considering the pinning effect of second phase particles on grain boundaries, the grain boundary energy couples the interaction between second phase and grains. The effect of second phase on dislocation density evolution is considered in the model, and the PSN and SIBM mechanism are both executed by limiting the nucleation position to the grain boundary and the second phase interface. For the validation, the initial topology consistent with initial microstructure is applied to the simulation of DRX kinetics and flow behavior of AZ80 magnesium alloy, and great reliability and accuracy of developed model is indicated. Furthermore, through the model, the microstructure evolution with different particle size and with different volume fraction of round particle during DRX process were simulated. The results show that particles with higher dispersion reduce the number of DRX nuclei, which indicate that second phase particles suppress the nucleation at grain boundaries because of the pinning effect.

Composites of transition metal oxides TMOs/Polymers have many modern technological, industrial, and biological applications. Co3O4 and CuO nanoparticles Nps were synthesized by sol-gel. Then they doped into polymethyl methacrylate PMMA via solution casting method. The obtained Nps and nanocomposite films were then investigated using several techniques. XRD and HR-TEM indicated the high purity of Co3O4 and CuONps of face-centered cubic fcc with 58 nm average particle size D av , and monoclinic structure with D av = 35 nm, respectively. The amorphous nature of PMMA was influenced after mixing with these Nps. SEM and FTIR confirmed the interaction between Nps and the polymer chains. The pure film showed transparency of about 90% and Nps addition narrowed the optical bandgap effectively while keeping the films with high transmittance. CuO is more effective than Co3O4 on the optical parameters of the films. The dielectric constant improved after adding the Nps, while all films have a low dielectric loss. Additionally, the effects of Co3O4 and CuO on the ac conductivity, Argand plots, and the dielectric modulus are reported.

The volume fraction of strain-induced -martensite as a function of the effective strain e was evaluated quantitatively using XRD and magnetic measurements. Considering the e magnitudes and the TEM data obtained, it is concluded that a grain refinement of austenitic structure passes ahead of the -martensite formation, particularly in the top surface layer. The nanocrystalline austenitic grain structure mean grain size15nm was observed at e = 0.45 , while the startup of the strain-induced martensitic transformation was revealed at the strain extent of 0.62. The nanostructured surface layer formed after straining to e = 0.8 already contains mainly the martensite nanograins characterized by an average size of about 10nm. Grain size increased gradually up to 60nm within the layer containing both austenite and martensite phases at a depth of about 30m from the treated surface.

For both as-cast and T6 treated composites, the in-situ Al3Ti particulates are in a blocky morphology with average size of 56m. Sr modified the Si particulates by reducing their size and aspect ratio, without a noticeable influence on the Al3Ti particulates. Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy EDS revealed the existence of Si in the blocky Al3Ti particulates in the as-cast composites likely to form an Al,Si3Ti phase. Solutionization at for 4h resulted in the enrichment of Si inside the Al3Ti particulates, raising a question about the stability of Al,Si3Ti as reported by others.

This paper systematically summarizes the cyclic deformation behaviors of different kinds of face-centered cubic fcc single crystals, including copper, nickel, silver, as well as copper-aluminium, copper-zinc alloys in attempt to provide a historical perspective of the developments over the last several decades. Combined with plenty of previous research results, the influencing factors on cyclic deformation behaviors can be listed as follows: orientations, stacking fault energy SFE, short-range order SRO and friction stress, or more generally, the ease of cross slip. Among them, the effect of orientations mainly reflects in the formation of the complex dislocation patterns, which depends on the activating secondary slip system. According to the effect of slip mode, the materials can be divided into two types: pure metals and alloys. For pure fcc metals, the effect of SFE is decisive. Due to the easy cross slip of screw dislocations, regular dislocation arrangements, e.g. veins, persistent slip bands labyrinth and cell patterns, are always to form. With increase in alloying element, antiphase boundary energy gradually replaces SFE to become a new decisive factor affecting the cyclic deformation behaviors of fcc alloy single crystals. The corresponding dislocation arrangements consist of dipole array and stacking faultsunder the influence of planar slip. The relationship among several factors is well explained, which will help us better understand the nature of the fatigue damage of metallic materials and then improve the performance of the related materials.

This study is concerned with the effects of high-energy accelerated electron beam irradiation on surface hardening and improvement of fatigue properties in an AISI 4140 steel currently used for automotive crankshaft. The 4140 steel specimens were irradiated in air by using a high-energy electron beam accelerator, and then microstructure, hardness, and fatigue properties were examined. Beam power was varied in the range of 5.27.7 kW by changing beam current. Upon irradiation, the unirradiated microstructure containing band structure was changed to martensite and bainite in the carbon-rich zone or ferrite, bainite, and martensite in the carbon-depleted zone. This microstructural modification improved greatly surface hardness and fatigue properties due to transformation of martensite whose amount and type were determined by heat input during irradiation. Thus, high-energy electron beam irradiation can be effectively applied to the surface hardening process of automotive parts. In order to investigate the thermal cycle during electron beam irradiation of quickly rotating specimens, the thermal analysis was also carried out using an analytical computer simulation.

The strength and stiffness of a shield tunnel segment can be improved significantly by bonding a steel plate at its inner surface. In this kind of strengthened segment, interface debonding is usually the controlling failure mode, and it strongly depends on the interfacial stresses of the adhesive layer between the segment and the steel plate. To deepen the understanding of the interfacial behaviour, this study proposes a three-dimensional fine finite element FE model regarding the interfacial stresses. An existing full-scale experimental result is then employed to confirm the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed model. Further, the fine finite element model is used to calculate the interfacial stress distributions and to evaluate the structural parameters on the interfacial behaviour of the strengthened segment.

The deformation and cavitation behavior of a Al4.4Cu1.5Mg/21SiCW composite under biaxial stress states with variable strain rate paths were investigated in this paper. The composite was bulged in dies with aspect ratios of 1:1, 4:3, 2:1, and 8:3 at the optimum temperature of. For each die, a two-stage strain rate path was used. A stress of 5.5MPa was first applied to the composite until it became deformed to a polar height of about 8.5mm. A second stress of 4MPa was then applied to a large strain or to a fracture. The strain distribution of the composite diaphragm deformed under this two-stage variable strain rate path in different dies was determined. It was found that the distribution is similar to that deformed at a constant strain rate path. The cavitation behavior and the limit strains of the composite under the two-stage strain rate path were also determined and compared with that under a constant strain rate path. The cavity growth rate parameter under the variable path was found to be slightly greater than the constant one, but smaller limit strains were observed in the sheet under the two-stage path. Using the experimental cavity growth rate parameter, the limit strains of the composite bulged at different stress ratios and the variable strain rate path were predicted using the model recently developed by the author. The trend of the prediction was in agreement with the experimental findings.","[('Superplasticity', 3, '0.828302'), ('Strain rate', 2, '0.69808245'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.6819748'), ('Composite number', 2, '0.66543055'), ('Strain (injury)', 2, '0.5438656'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.4736256'), ('Alloy', 2, '0.15202588'), ('Medicine', 0, '0.0'), ('Internal medicine', 1, '0.0')]",S154732359,"Al4.4Cu1.5Mg,SiCW"

Quasi-static crack advance has been statistically analysed as a function of interfacial toughness using a randomized two-dimensional, polycrystalline model. The average macroscopically observable toughness is calculated to be a strong function of interfacial toughness if the interfaces, grain boundaries in this case, have a fracture resistance less than approximately 1 2 that of the grains. Alternatively, the relative amount of crack deflection, as indicated by the percentage of interfacial failure, is a relatively homogeneous function of the interfacial toughness if interfacial fracture resistance is higher than about 0.3 int . Combining these predictions gives a quantitative measure of both the expected material strength and resulting fracture surface roughness.

Low temperature deposition LTD is an actual frontier in materials sicence and engineering, especially for thin film technology. In this paper the fundamentals and processing of low temperature deposition of TiN coating are reviewed. The prerequisites of a low temperature deposition process are enough good densification, hardness and adhesion of the deposited coating. The fundamentals of low temperature deposition are structure zone model and nonequilibrium plasma vapor growth in a combined DC and pulsed electromagnetic fields, namely a combination of a DC bias voltage superimposed by a DC pulsed bias voltage with variable frequency and peak voltage height. Low temperature deposition processing can be realized simply with only stationary electric fields. However, sensitivity of the product quality to the process parameters is the main barrier of this processing in the way to mass production. Low temperature deposition processing using the effects of a combined DC and pulsed electromagnetic fields has attained some promising results for the future commercialization. But they need still further systematic and deep study. The application of low temperature deposition processing is not limited in range of low melting substrate materials. It is also important for internal stress control, defect minimization, microstructure densification and performance improvement for coatings on broad spectrum of substrate materials as well as for different types of applications.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.8630706'), ('Deposition (geology)', 3, '0.66180676'), ('Tin', 2, '0.56737864'), ('Substrate (aquarium)', 2, '0.49028972'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.46830145'), ('Coating', 2, '0.4672088'), ('Thin film', 2, '0.4400547'), ('Pulsed DC', 5, '0.43092877'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.34598476'), ('Electronic engineering', 1, '0.33946934'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.29394794'), ('Sputter deposition', 4, '0.24737471'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.24642017'), ('Sputtering', 3, '0.18085423'), ('Paleontology', 1, '0.0'), ('Oceanography', 1, '0.0'), ('Sediment', 2, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0'), ('Biology', 0, '0.0'), ('Geology', 0, '0.0')]",S135187643,TiN

We have built and operated a novel setup for the characterization and identification of gases or vapors based on sequential position readout via a beam-deflection technique from a microfabricated array of eight cantilever-type sensors. Each of the cantilevers can be coated on one side with a dif- ferent sensor material to detect specific chemical interactions. We demonstrate that disturbances from vibrations and turbu- lent gas flow can be effectively removed in array sensors by taking difference signals with reference cantilevers. For ex- ample, H2 can be detected by its adsorption on a Pt-coated sensor because a change in surface stress causes a static bending of the sensor. The diffusion of various alcohols into polymethylmethacrylate induces resonance frequency shifts in a dynamic measuring mode and bending in the static mode, which allows one to distinguish between the various alcohols. Sensor devices for detection of gases and vapors via spe- cific coatings are gradually gaining importance in chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry owing to the increas- ing demand for detection of analytes at monolayer coverage. A field of increasing interest is the construction of so-called electronic noses capable of discerning different odors via a typical response pattern of the receptor layers to an analyte. Most devices currently applied involve square centimeter- sized detection areas and comparatively large gas volumes typically 50- 1000 cm 3 resulting in relatively long response","[('Cantilever', 2, '0.8626689'), ('Identification (biology)', 2, '0.5253812'), ('Chemical sensor', 3, '0.52384114'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.50477135'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.4087047'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.34203178'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.341643'), ('Analytical Chemistry (journal)', 2, '0.32747775'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.3252396'), ('Environmental chemistry', 1, '0.20122948'), ('Physical chemistry', 1, '0.13908163'), ('Biology', 0, '0.07955825'), ('Electrode', 2, '0.0'), ('Botany', 1, '0.0')]",S52123058,"H2,Pt"

The discs were fired in a 5 cm diameter microwave plasma ball, under a hydrogen atmosphere at a pressure of 2 kPa. There was an increase in fired pellet transverse rupture strength TRS with plasma treatment duration. The mechanical properties of the sintered nickel discs were compared based on TRS, Rockwell hardness tests and density measurements. The morphology of the sintered discs was compared using microscopy and SEM. Comparison disc sintering studies were carried out using both a non plasma microwave and tube furnace firing. Using the microwave plasma sintering process full sintered disc strength of 1000 N based on 3-point bend tests was achieved after a 10 minute treatment time. In contrast the sintering time in the tube furnace treatment involved total processing time of up to 6 hours. The non plasma microwave system involved intermediate treatment periods of 2 hours. The degree of sintering between the individual nickel powder particles can be precisely controlled by the duration of the treatment time in the plasma.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.9094155'), ('Sintering', 2, '0.78127813'), ('Microwave', 2, '0.7456041'), ('Tube furnace', 2, '0.589969'), ('Rockwell scale', 2, '0.5653088'), ('Nickel', 2, '0.52759105'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.5174311'), ('Ball mill', 2, '0.5126187'), ('Plasma', 2, '0.49107623'), ('Particle size', 2, '0.47890675'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.4457133'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.07622492'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0')]",S87940674,N

The results are interpreted in the light of a recently proposed fracture criterion for hydrides at cracks and notch tips. This criterion is based on the premise that crack initiation occurs if the local tensile stress at the hydride exceeds that for hydride fracture. The local stress at the hydride is expressed as the sum of the peak stress at the notch and the stress in the hydride arising from the hydride formation process. The fracture stress of the hydride is obtained experimentally. An approximate analytical method, based on a modified Neuber's rule, was used to calculate the plastic zone size needed to estimate the peak stress at the notch.

Spray rolling is a strip-casting technology that combines elements of spray forming and twin-roll casting. It consists of atomizing molten metal with a high velocity inert gas, quenching the resultant droplets in flight, and directing the spray between mill rolls. In-flight convection heat transfer from atomized droplets and conduction heat transfer at the rolls rapidly remove the metal's latent heat. Hot deformation of the semi-solid material in the rolls results in fully consolidated, rapidly-solidified strip. Spray rolling operates at a higher solidification rate than conventional twin-roll casting and is able to process a broader range of alloys at high production rates. A laboratory-scale strip caster was constructed and used to evaluate the interplay of processing parameters and strip quality for strips up to 200mm wide and 1.66.4mm thick.

Two experimental procedures were implemented under both Ar and CO atmospheres: a FeMn alloy and slag placed next to each other on a graphite substrate; and b one droplet dropped on top of the other. FactSage is applied to calculate reactions and their equilibrium. The current work presents and demonstrates the suggested methodologies. The results indicate that the wetting between slag and FeMn alloy is relatively stable at temperatures up to above their melting points, regardless of the droplet size and atmosphere. MnO reduction is accelerated at higher temperature, especially in CO, thus increasing the wetting between FeMn alloy and slag, eventually fusing together.

The characteristics of the contacts of iron containing metals were slightly better than the contact characteristics of non-ferrous metals due to weaker adhesion.

Linear friction welding LFW, an emerging automated technology, has potential for solid-state joining of dissimilar materials bi-metals to enable tailoring of the mechanical performance, whilst limiting the assembly weight for increased fuel efficiency. However, bi-metallic welds are quite difficult to manufacture, especially when the material combinations can lead to the formation of intermetallic brittle phases at the interface, such as the case with assembly of Ti base alloys with Ni base superalloys. The intermetallic phase, once formed, lowers the performance of the as-manufactured properties and its growth during elevated temperature service can lead to unreliable performance. In this project, it was demonstrated that linear friction welding can be applied to join Ti-6%Al-4%V workhorse Ti alloy to INCONEL 718 workhorse Ni-base superalloy with minimized interaction at the interface. Of particular merit is that no intermediate layer between the Ti alloy and Ni-base superalloy was needed for bonding.

Within the framework of continuum plasticity theory, a numerical analysis in this investigation is made of the role of microstructures of fibrous composites against transverse plastic flow by means of the finite element method FEM. In this way, the effective mechanical properties can be related quantitatively to the micro structures of composites reinforced by randomly arranged fibers. The effects of different cross-sectional geometry, such as the fiber shape circular, square and lozenge, size, and random fiber distribution on the transverse elastic and plastic deformation of the metal-matrix composites with specific randomly distributed, aligned continuous fibers, are examined. Numerical results show that the overall transverse plastic flow of the composites is rather sensitive to the fiber geometric parameters while the elastic properties exhibit a much lower sensitivity to the fiber distribution. The interference of fibers with flow paths is seen from stress contours analysis to play an important role in the transverse strengthening due to the constraint imposed by the reinforcements.

The unloading failure process in mining engineering scenarios is similar to the loading failure process at different loading rates indoor. To clarify the relationship between the mechanical properties of backfill and the loading rate, a particle flow code 2D-based numerical simulation was performed to establish the backfill model, and tests involving five loading rates were conducted. The following results were obtained: 1 the compressive strength of the backfill body increases linearly with the increase in the loading rate. The peak strain increases in an S-shaped manner, and the modulus of elasticity first increases and then decreases. 2 The evolution of cracks is similar to that of damage energy consumption, and a smaller rate means that the curves inflection point arrives earlier. 3 Tensile failure is the dominant failure mode.the rate increases, the model destruction mode transforms from single to multiple failures, and the crack distribution becomes denser. 4 The backfill body exhibits a uniform destruction form at all loading rates.

Different ZrTiAlNiCu bulk metallic glasses have been processed. They have been characterized by neutron and X-ray diffraction in the glassy state and after DSC heating up to crystallization. The homogeneous visco-plasticity of the glasses has been studied in the under-cooled liquid state by compression tests at constant strain-rate and by differential mechanical tests with strain-rate jumps at different temperatures. The flow stress appears to be strongly thermally activated. Another characteristic feature of the deformation of the fully amorphous state is that the flow stress is independent of the strain-rate path followed to reach a given level of strain. The stressstrain curves and their dependence on temperature and strain-rate are then discussed in terms of Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscosity. It is shown that a reduced viscosity can be scaled on a master curve, independently of the strain-rate and temperature. A second analysis of the results is made, in terms of free volume.

Magnetoplasmonics is an emerging field of intense research on materials combining magnetic and plasmonic functionalities. The novel optical and magneto-optical MO properties displayed by these materials could allow the design of a new class of magnetically controllable optical nano-devices. In this work, we investigate the effects of a non-absorbing insulating substrate on the MO activity of pure ferromagnetic disk-shaped nanostructures supporting localized plasmon resonances. We show that the red-shift of the localized plasmon resonance, related to the modification of the localization of the electromagnetic field due to the substrate, is not the only effect that the substrate has on the MO response. We demonstrate that the reflectivity of the substrate itself plays a key role in determining the MO response of the system. We discuss why it is so and provide a description of the modeling tools suitable to take into account both effects.

The service life of rolling element bearings can usually be predicted with good accuracy. However, the damage phenomenon white etching cracks WEC can lead to premature and unforeseeable failures. The formation of zones with strongly decreased grain sizes at the crack faces is a characteristic of this type of failure. An earlier study showed that it is possible to reproduce this type of failure by multiaxial fatigue experiments with superposed cyclic compression and torsion. The present study shows the analysis of the stress state of those multiaxial fatigue tests with stress-based critical plane criteria. Using the critical plane results as a basis for a fracture mechanical analysis, a correlation is found between the crack length, the associated plastic zone size, and the extent of the transformed microstructure. This correlation is very similar to our results of the study of fine granular areas FGA, a very high cycle fatigue phenomenon in bearing steels. It is argued that a plasticity-driven mechanism similar to the one proposed for FGA formation is responsible for WEC formation, too. Additional factors that are often cited as promoting WEC formation could explain the shift from very high cycle fatigue in the case of FGA to the early failures due to WEC.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.756496'), ('Torsion (gastropod)', 2, '0.57038903'), ('Stress concentration', 3, '0.5103292'), ('Plasticity', 2, '0.5092999'), ('Microstructure', 2, '0.49258333'), ('Structural engineering', 1, '0.4609277'), ('Fracture (geology)', 2, '0.45687878'), ('Fatigue testing', 2, '0.41036165'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.38703132'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.38677093'), ('Fracture mechanics', 2, '0.2742709'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.13078406'), ('Medicine', 0, '0.0'), ('Surgery', 1, '0.0')]",S4210175061,

The diameters and morphology were analyzed by SEM, observing a wide array of nanostructures with diameters of ~310 to 693nm. Chemical characterization was assessed by FT-IR spectroscopy and the functionalized PCL was characterized through ninhydrin assay resulting in 0.36mM NH2/mg fiber. Swelling tests were performed for 24h, obtaining 320% for the majority of the fibers indicating morphological stability and good water uptake. In addition, contact angle analysis demonstrated adequate permeability and differences for each system depending mainly upon the type of biopolymer incorporated and the functionalization of PCL, ranging the values from 108 to 17.

An intense UVvisible photoluminescence of vacuum deposited Sb2O3 thin film surface crowded with randomly oriented thorn like structures have been studied using photoluminescence PL spectroscopy. The resulting UV emissions are near band edge NBE emissions. All the visible deep level emissions DLE are due to oxygen defect states. The thorn like structures is achieved by the inclined arrangement of substrates with respect to the source in the vacuum chamber. Some distorted polygonal shapes also emerge among the randomly oriented thorns giving an impression of a hybrid formation upon annealing. This formation of various structures leads to decreased UVNBE and defect level PL emission. The excitation wavelength dependence of PL emission has also been studied. The optical band gap energy of the film is found to be varying from 3.64 to 3.42eV on annealing.

Solutionizing and quenching are the key steps in the fabrication of heat-treatable aluminum parts such as AA2618 compressor impellers for turbochargers as they highly impact the mechanical characteristics of the product. In particular, quenching induces residual stresses that can cause unacceptable distortions during machining and unfavorable stresses in service. Predicting and controlling stress generation during quenching of large AA2618 forgings are therefore of particular interest. Since possible precipitation during quenching may affect the local yield strength of the material and thus impact the level of macroscale residual stresses, consideration of this phenomenon is required.

Instead of modeling precipitation that occurs during quenching, the model parameters are identified using a limited number of tensile tests achieved after representative interrupted cooling paths in a Gleeble machine.

In addition, the different substitution sequences and the W/C ratio on lightweight concrete behaviour were evaluated, in order to determine the W/C ratio influence on the improvement of the lightweight concrete mechanical properties while knowing that the mixing water quantity gives the cement paste manoeuvrability and mechanical strength effects. The last part of this paper, therefore, was to provide statistical survey for estimating strength and weight reduction through the different natural aggregate substitutions to improve the lightweight concrete properties. The results achieved in a significant olive-pomace lower adhesion with the matrix after the cement setting, making the lightweight concrete mechanical strength weak. However, this work can open several perspectives: Results modeling and correlation with an experimental approach, the evolution and determination of lightweight concrete characteristics when exposed to high temperatures and thermohydric properties.","[('Pomace', 2, '0.67665845'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.66904813'), ('Aggregate (composite)', 2, '0.661497'), ('Cement', 2, '0.6385439'), ('Porosity', 2, '0.5407254'), ('Mixing (physics)', 2, '0.50620407'), ('Mechanical strength', 2, '0.50538'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.49751785'), ('Matrix (chemical analysis)', 2, '0.46474403'), ('Work (physics)', 2, '0.42608255'), ('Properties of concrete', 3, '0.42273852'), ('Material properties', 2, '0.42028588'), ('Environmental science', 0, '0.3492639'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.11434591'), ('Mechanical engineering', 1, '0.088293016'), ('Biochemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.0')]",S4210175061,W

According to this feather, we developed an effective damage location and situation assessment algorithm based on residual mode vector with the first mode information of targeted structure, which utilized the quantitative relationship between first natural modes of global structure with the change of the element stiffness. Firstly, the element damage location is determined with exploitation of the sparseness of element stiffness matrices based on the discontinuity of damaged members. Then, according to the distribution characteristics of the corresponding residual mode vector, the nodal equilibrium equation about the damage parameter is established based on the residual mode vector, and the damage coefficients of structural elements are evaluated with the proposed equations. Two numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm. The results showed that the proposed damage identification method is consistent with the preset damage. It can even accurately identify large-degree damages.

Metastable austenitic steels reveal a partial martensitic transformation during monotonic and cyclic loading. The volume fraction of martensite formed depends strongly on the amplitude and frequency of plastic strain, specimen geometry, the temperature, grain size, and the chemical composition. Particularly the latter has been varied by a carburization/decarburization treatment applied to the three austenitic steels AISI 304, AISI 304L, and AISI 301 corresponding German designations: X5 CrNi189 , X2 CrNi1811 , X12 CrNi177 in the present study.

Two types of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene MAPP coupling agent which is MAPP1 Polybond 3200 and MAPP2 Orevac CA100 also have been used to enhance the adhesion between fibre and matrix. Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical constituents in pure PP and the NWKFMRPP composites.

Water absorption and thickness swelling test were also been carried out to reveal the physical properties of pure PP and NWKFMRPP composites.

The prepared DDS were tested in vitro using breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma cell lines and in vivo using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model CAM. Both assays showed the best results for the Hs578T breast cancer cells, with a higher potentiation for 5-FU encapsulated in the zeolite LTL.

Changes in the mechanical stability of austenite with strain state is a significant aspect that needs to be addressed in the use of medium Mn steel in automobile body construction. New insights are provided in this paper to understand strain-state-dependent austenite stability in a 5wt% Mn-containing steel based on the analysis of the Schmid factor by electron backscatter diffraction and the calculation of the work done by the applied stress. Four strain states, namely uniaxial tension, simple shear, plane strain, and equibiaxial stretch, were considered and digital image correlation was used to capture the strain field during the entire deformation process. Results show that the mechanical stability of austenite decreases when strain state changes from uniaxial tension to plane strain, and further decreases in the case of equibiaxial stretch due to the increasing work done by the applied stress and the increasing Schmid factor. The austenite acquires the highest mechanical stability when it is deformed at the simple shear state, which corresponds to the lowest work done by the applied stress.

The FESEM results clearly indicate that there was no change in morphology of ZnO nanostructures with the substitution of Sb in ZnO lattices.

Thermo-mechanical fatigue TMF failure is the major problem of the cylinder head subjected to combined variations in temperature and loading during operation. This study mainly focuses on the TMF property and the life prediction of vermicular graphite iron VGI. The ferrite clusters can be easily found from the microstructure and fractography images. Compared with the TMF experimental data testing at 125400 and 125500, significant cyclic hardening occurs in the former and slight hardening does in the latter. Depending on the difference in the damage mechanism between TMF and iso-thermal low-cycle fatigue LCF, based on the hysteresis energy, a life prediction method has been proposed at first. By the minimum amount of LCF and TMF tests, the present method can predict the TMF life rapidly, accurately and cheaply.

The structure-property relationship for recycled carbon fibres is investigated by characterisation of the structure changes induced by the pyrolysis recycling process. Two important factors influencing the properties of recycled carbon fibres are identified for various recycling processes: oxidative effect and thermal effect. The oxidative effect results in surface defects, and the surface defects causes a reduction in tensile strength and lateral crystallite size. The thermal effect of the recycling process results in an expansion in the distance between graphite layers and a decrease in surface oxygen concentration, which would lead to a drop in interfacial shear strength with epoxy resins. The tensile strength of recycled carbon fibres has a strong correlation with the intensity ratio of the D and G bands of the Raman spectra ID/IG. With an increase in ID/IG, the tensile strength of recycled carbon fibre decreases linearly.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.8617076'), ('Pyrolysis', 2, '0.79883397'), ('Process (computing)', 2, '0.54229975'), ('Carbon fibers', 3, '0.5373835'), ('Solid mechanics', 2, '0.5308842'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.49492377'), ('Property (philosophy)', 2, '0.4706587'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.41688776'), ('Polymer science', 1, '0.40795264'), ('Waste management', 1, '0.3621984'), ('Composite number', 2, '0.065612465'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0'), ('Philosophy', 0, '0.0'), ('Epistemology', 1, '0.0'), ('Computer science', 0, '0.0'), ('Operating system', 1, '0.0')]",S26125866,

The problem of crack initiation at the interface of a spherical inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix subjected to a remote tension is studied by the means of the coupled criterion of the finite fracture mechanics. This allows us to predict the critical tension necessary to initiate the crack at the interface as a function of the elastic properties of the particle and matrix, the particle size and the main parameters defining the strength and fracture properties of the interface. The coupled criterion assumes that a crack of a finite length appears when the next two criteria are simultaneously fulfilled: on the one hand a stress criterion which imposes a condition over the stresses at points where the crack initiates and on the other hand the crack onset must be energetically allowed. The coupled criterion is applied with the aid of an axisymmetric boundary element method code. The numerical model shows a strong influence of the spherical-inclusion radius on the critical remote tension.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.84766716'), ('Inclusion (mineral)', 2, '0.6017332'), ('Matrix (chemical analysis)', 2, '0.5692794'), ('Stress (linguistics)', 2, '0.5640312'), ('Interface (matter)', 4, '0.5525298'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.5045532'), ('Energy (signal processing)', 2, '0.4945788'), ('Structural engineering', 1, '0.36979145'), ('Statistics', 1, '0.11464429'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.10119328'), ('Mathematics', 0, '0.083832055'), ('Mineralogy', 1, '0.08205035'), ('Linguistics', 1, '0.0'), ('Philosophy', 0, '0.0'), ('Capillary number', 3, '0.0'), ('Capillary action', 2, '0.0'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0')]",S2898151498,

The manufacturing of state-of-the-art electronic devices involves an increasing demand for the accurate determination of ultra-shallow electrical carrier profiles related to the need to monitor the activation of the dopants with reduced thermal budgets. For sub-micron structures down to 100nm a qualified conventional spreading resistance probe system is an attractive tool for the reliable measurement of the resistivity and carrier depth variations in silicon due to its high geometrical resolution nm and high dynamic range nine orders of magnitude. The spreading resistance SR roadmap for future process development sub-50nm profiles, however, shows that there is a need for a significant reduction of the involved contact size and tip separation, a higher depth resolution sub-nm and an improved quantification. The recently introduced scanning spreading resistance microscopy technique resolves some of the involved issues such as the smaller contact size 2050nm and the higher geometrical depth resolution sub-nm when applied on a bevelled surface. Further developments are, however, needed in the fields of tip configuration, surface preparation and contact modelling to achieve timely all the needs of the SR roadmap. This is expected to lead to a new instrument, the NanoProfiler, using two small 2050nm contact size, closely spaced 250nm, conductive tips mounted on an atomic force microscope-based system.

Severe plastic deformation SPD makes it possible to refine grain size in many metallic materials. Recently, we have developed a new SPD process designated the severe torsion straining process STSP. This process requires no die but one side of a rod is rotated with respect to the other while producing a local heated zone in the rod and cooling both sides of the heated zone. Torsion strain is then introduced in the local heated zone. The STSP can be a continuous process because the rod is moved in the longitudinal direction while introducing torsion strain through the rotation. For grain refinement using the STSP, various factors may affect, which are the rotation speed, moving speed, straining temperature, cooling rate and diameter of the rod. In this study, the STSP is applied to grain refinement of an A5056 AlMg commercial alloy and the factors affecting the grain refinement are optimized. STSP was conducted at a temperature in the range from to.

The TS Turin Shroud is a linen cloth which enveloped the dead body of a tortured and crucified man that is believed by many to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ.

The present paper discusses the results obtained using innovative dating methods based on the analysis of mechanical parameters breaking strength, Young modulus and loss factor and of opto- chemical ones FT-IR and Raman. To obtain mechanical results it was necessary to build a particular cycling-loads machine able to measure the mechanical parameters of single flax fibersmm long. A least squares multi linear regression MLR has been applied to the measured mechanical data estimating a TS age equal to 260 AD. Furthermore, two opto- chemical methods have been applied to test the linen fabric, obtaining a date of 250 BC by a FT-IR ATR analysis and a date of 30 AD by a Raman analysis. These two dates combined with the mechanical result, weighted through their estimated square uncertainty inverses, give a final date of the Turin Shroud of 90 AD 200 years at 95% confidence level. While this date is both compatible with the time in which Jesus Christ lived in Palestine and with very recent results based on numismatic dating, it is not compatible with the 1988 radiocarbon measurements that should be repeated after the necessary clarifications relative to the possible environmental factors that could have biased the results.","[('Shroud', 2, '0.9162079'), ('Art', 0, '0.4162726'), ('Archaeology', 1, '0.41495302'), ('Geology', 0, '0.38585728'), ('Mineralogy', 1, '0.34307194'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.32727325'), ('History', 0, '0.18165386')]",S4210175061,BC

Nonoriented electrical steels have been widely used as core materials in motors and generators. For these applications low core loss and high permeability are required. The magnetic properties of these steels depend on the grain size and crystallographic texture of the annealed final products. The problems related to grain size control have been extensively investigated, while texture control has received much less attention. The technologies used to control the grain size in nonoriented electrical steels have approached to their limits. However, there is still some possibility for improvement of the magnetic properties through texture control. In order to explore this possibility, the evolution of recrystallization texture for nonoriented electrical steels with 2% Si was systematically studied. Texture change during grain growth was additionally analyzed. The formation of recrystallization texture is explained by oriented nucleation. This is supported by the fact that the area fraction of nuclei or recrystallized grains with specific orientation to all new grains remains almost constant during the progress of recrystallization. Most nuclei have a high misorientation angle of 25~55 with the surrounding deformed matrices. During the progress of grain growth, Goss and {111}&lt;112&gt; components are weakened and the random texture is strengthened. The grains of the Goss and {111}&lt;112&gt; orientations have smaller grain size than those of random orientation.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.8650985'), ('Misorientation', 4, '0.84051085'), ('Recrystallization (geology)', 2, '0.79290116'), ('Nucleation', 2, '0.71653306'), ('Grain size', 2, '0.6630032'), ('Electrical steel', 2, '0.65917313'), ('Annealing (glass)', 2, '0.5881704'), ('Grain growth', 3, '0.51313215'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.4919674'), ('Electron backscatter diffraction', 3, '0.48458302'), ('Microstructure', 2, '0.41313583'), ('Grain boundary', 3, '0.19568425'), ('Paleontology', 1, '0.0'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Biology', 0, '0.0')]",S87940674,Si

The effects of increasing the hole diameter, hole length circular and square, number of holes and also the effect of different locations of such defects in hybrid graphene-boron nitride sheets on their mechanical properties have been analyzed and discussed. The findings indicate that the presence of holes in the considered structures reduces their mechanical properties including the failure strength and strain and Youngs modulus; but the effect of such defects on Youngs modulus is much less than that on the other two mechanical parameters. Also, it has been demonstrated that the circular holes have a less severe effect on mechanical properties than the square holes. For example, by making circular holes of 10A diameter in a hybrid graphene-boron nitride sheet in the left graphene region GFL, its failure strength is reduced 20% relative to that of a defect-free structure; while the Youngs modulus diminishes by 10% under the same conditions.

A new dual-scale submicron and nanoscale FeCrSi ternary second-phase has been successfully constructed in designed Cu-2.5Fe-0.3Cr-0.2Si alloy. The synergistic addition of Cr and Si promotes the transformation of the submicron Fe phase morphology from square to flower shape in as-cast alloys. The orientation relationship between nanoscale FeCrSi phase and Cu matrix is: 011 Cu//011 Fe11CrSi4 and the misorientation angle between the 200 of the Cu matrix and the 022 of the Fe11CrSi4 phase is about 4. After three-stage thermomechanical treatment, the tensile strength and electrical conductivity of the alloy are 435 MPa and 70.52 %IACS, respectively.

When a liquid is supercooled, its structural equilibration time eq increases sharply approaching the glass transition temperature Tg, below which it is kinetically arrested in the out of equilibrium glassy state. Upon annealing below Tg, such glassy state relaxes toward the equilibrium state. There is growing evidence that such relaxation process is quite complex, influenced by the complexity of the potential energy landscape. Here we report the observation of a hierarchical aging pathway in the process of the glass-to-supercooled liquid transition in various molecular glass forming systems. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that the glassy state upon annealing below Tg firstly enters a transient metastable supercooled liquid state with slightly higher enthalpies than that of the equilibrium supercooled liquid state when extrapolated to below Tg. This observation is also confirmed by structural measurements via Raman scattering. The dynamics of the transient metastable-to-stable supercooled liquid transition exhibits characteristics of thermodynamic transition at spinodal temperature Tsp slightly above Tg, leading to anomalous behaviors such as the appearance of a transition-like behavior in the plot of fragility measurements. These observations imply that the free energy landscape of the supercooled liquid develops complexity with qualitative changes approaching Tg and could have strong influence on the process of the glass transition.","[('Supercooling', 2, '0.97676426'), ('Glass transition', 3, '0.8365655'), ('Metastability', 2, '0.8202568'), ('Differential scanning calorimetry', 2, '0.70419884'), ('Thermodynamics', 1, '0.67087114'), ('Annealing (glass)', 2, '0.5515792'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.53406674'), ('Molecular dynamics', 2, '0.4887507'), ('Spinodal', 3, '0.4621343'), ('Thermodynamic equilibrium', 2, '0.45956993'), ('Energy landscape', 2, '0.4432575'), ('Relaxation (psychology)', 2, '0.43190873'), ('Fragility', 2, '0.42226174'), ('Chemical physics', 1, '0.38792333'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.3065725'), ('Phase (matter)', 2, '0.15004292'), ('Polymer', 2, '0.12825578'), ('Computational chemistry', 1, '0.100400805'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.085201085'), ('Psychology', 0, '0.0'), ('Social psychology', 1, '0.0'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.0')]",S2764782236,

A review is presented of the relaxation phenomena due to the intrinsic properties of dislocations. The Bordoni peaks of internal friction were first observed in f.c.c. metals. Their essential features primary and secondary characteristics have been deduced from the ensemble of experimental results in the literature. The stability of these peaks during annealing after cold work strongly suggests that the Bordoni relaxation is linked to the intrinsic properties of dislocations. Thus, we present the principal theoretical models proposed to explain intrinsic dislocation relaxations. There are: the relaxation models based upon the thermally-activated generation of double-links, models based upon the migration of dislocation dipoles and jogs. A detailed comparison of the predictions of these models with the published experimental results leads us to the conclusion that the double-kink relaxation model is the most suitable. The experimental results obtained on deformed h.c.p. and b.c.c. metals, ionic and covalent crystal-line materials are also reviewed. In these materials there are many relaxation phenomena attributed to dislocations, and there is a good deal of variability in the results reported from one laboratory to another. A coherent picture appears to be emerging in the case of h.c.p. and b.c.c. metals; but at present, it is difficult to attribute a precise mechanism to each internal friction peak. In addition, studies are reviewed of microplasticity in the temperature range of the Bordoni relaxation. A correlation between the mechanisms of microplasticity and internal friction is demonstrated.

To overcome these difficulties, a new fatigue model dedicated to cylinder heads in Aluminum - Silicon alloy has been developed in Renault powertrain division. The model is based on fatigue crack growth modelling in order to take into account various and combined load ratio in one hand, and typical characteristics of the microstructure of casting alloy in the other hand. This paper presents the theoretical basis of this model and the associated identification methodology for two different aluminum alloys.","[('Cylinder head', 3, '0.6789777'), ('Finite element method', 2, '0.5694996'), (""Paris' law"", 4, '0.54177773'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.53998303'), ('Structural engineering', 1, '0.50172615'), ('Cylinder', 2, '0.4776034'), ('Coolant', 2, '0.46319953'), ('Automotive industry', 2, '0.436996'), ('Casting', 2, '0.43392807'), ('Fatigue testing', 2, '0.42525697'), ('Crack closure', 3, '0.41575757'), ('Fracture mechanics', 2, '0.39964485'), ('Mechanical engineering', 1, '0.32614526'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.26463202'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.22084862'), ('Internal combustion engine', 2, '0.15591705'), ('Aerospace engineering', 1, '0.0')]",S4210175061,

In recent years, the oil and gas industries have been developing significantly. In this regard, there was a great need for the construction of main pipelines, which consist of pipes and connecting parts. The production of connecting parts of pipeline has not been studied enough to date. This article describes the process of stamping halves of stamped-welded elbows. During the stamping operation, the workpiece wall is thinned. The process of modeling this operation in a software of modeling by finite element method Deform-3D is described. The place of the greatest thinning of the wall was determined with the help of Deform-3D. The results of modeling and experimental production coincided. The main factors that may influence the degree of thinning were identified. Experimental calculations were performed in Deform-3D with a variation of these factors.a result of the experiments carried out, the most significant factor was determined and an option was proposed to solve the problem of wall thinning. Solving this problem will help reduce the cost of production by 1.5 times.","[('Welding', 2, '0.69803745'), ('Thinning', 2, '0.6962236'), ('Stamping', 2, '0.6749841'), ('Pipeline (software)', 2, '0.63239586'), ('Process (computing)', 2, '0.5861837'), ('Finite element method', 2, '0.55349725'), ('Structural engineering', 1, '0.5285427'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.44298828'), ('Pipeline transport', 2, '0.41714582'), ('Mechanical engineering', 1, '0.41425353'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.34471095'), ('Computer science', 0, '0.2882894'), ('Ecology', 1, '0.0'), ('Biology', 0, '0.0'), ('Operating system', 1, '0.0')]",S87940674,

The fabrication of graphene devices can be challenging due to exposure to harsh chemicals and mechanical wear such as ultrasonication used for cleaning in photolithography and metal deposition. Common graphene processing methods often damage fragile graphene sheets and can ruin the device during fabrication. The authors report a facile method to overcome many of these challenges, which is specifically compatible with graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition CVD. Using e-beam assisted metal deposition to deposit fine platinum features, electrodes can be deposited directly on graphene while still on the copper foil used as the catalyst during the CVD growth. The graphene and electrodes are then transferred to an insulating substrate, without further processing. This method preserves the graphene/metal interface from exposure to harsh chemicals used in traditional lithography methods, and avoids many of the conventional processing steps, which can cause unwanted doping, and damage or destroy the graphene. The authors observe an increase in Raman D-mode in the graphene under the Pt deposit, which suggests that the deposition method facilitates chemisorption by slightly abrading the surface of graphene surface during deposition. Using e-beam assisted electrode deposition in conjunction with masked CVD graphene growth on copper, the authors show the feasibility of fabricating complete graphene devices without subjecting the graphene to lithography, plasma etching, metal lift-off steps, or even shadow mask processing.","[('Graphene', 2, '0.9484472'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.7627828'), ('Chemical vapor deposition', 2, '0.7031091'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.6226294'), ('Graphene foam', 4, '0.5547091'), ('Graphene oxide paper', 3, '0.5523367'), ('Fabrication', 3, '0.49175003'), ('Graphene nanoribbons', 3, '0.4589871'), ('Electron beam physical vapor deposition', 3, '0.45259428'), ('Electrode', 2, '0.4506996'), ('Raman spectroscopy', 2, '0.43378565'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.34269077'), ('Optics', 1, '0.10817841'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.10662606'), ('Medicine', 0, '0.0'), ('Alternative medicine', 2, '0.0'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Physical chemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Pathology', 1, '0.0')]",S4210235835,Pt

In this study, the main effects of seven alloying elements, viz., C, Mn, Cr, Ni, Mo, Nb and V, on the activation energy of recrystallisation were further examined by using eight experimental steels based on an orthogonal Taguchi L8 matrix.

The huge cost of energy associated with the breaking down of high molecular weight rubber during adhesive production has placed a demand for alternative processing technology. In this study, the use of benzoyl peroxide as a peptizer to lower the molecular weight of natural rubber has been reported. The properties of natural rubber-based solvent adhesive produced by mechanical mastication and peptizer were also compared. Natural rubber NR was masticated in a two-roll mill at for 30 mins and was processed into adhesive using xylene as solvent. Similarly, adhesives were formulated by chemical break down of the heavy natural rubber molecules using benzoyl peroxide as peptizer. The peptizer loading was varied from 0.2 1.0 parts per hundred rubber phr of rubber at in a water bath while other compounding additives were kept constants for all samples under study. The adhesives produced were subjected to the following test: viscosity, lap shear test, T-peel test and drying time test. Other properties studied are weathering resistance, heat resistance and effect of moisture on the adhesives bond on different substrates. The result shows that the viscosity of the adhesives increases with increasing peptizer loading and the masticated sample has a viscosity slightly lower than that of 0.8phr and 1.0phr peptizer loading. Furthermore, T-peel test shows that 0.4 phr peptizer loading has a better average T-peel strength for the bonds while the masticated sample had the least average T-peel strength when compared with all samples. The sample with 1.0phr peptizer loading had the least decrease in shear strength while the 0.2 peptizer loading had the maximum decrease in shear strength. Finally, the FT-IR spectra shows similarities in spectra but with difference in the intensity of the peaks, indicating the ability of the benzoyl peroxide to effectively oxidize the natural rubber as compared with the mechanical masticated sample. The peak of 1080 cm-1 in the peptized sample indicates a major difference with the spectra of mechanical masticated sample. Generally, the benzoyl peroxide effectively lowered the molecular weight of the natural rubber which is evident in the viscosity, reduced process time and ease of the adhesive formulation.","[('Natural rubber', 2, '0.8729115'), ('Adhesive', 3, '0.82048786'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.7441699'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.7284447'), ('Compounding', 2, '0.5171901'), ('Viscosity', 2, '0.507697'), ('Mooney viscosity', 4, '0.5052298'), ('Benzoyl peroxide', 4, '0.4896317'), ('Elastomer', 2, '0.4731135'), ('Solvent', 2, '0.46583667'), ('Polymer', 2, '0.37137216'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.20354283'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.12550023'), ('Copolymer', 3, '0.078145266'), ('Monomer', 3, '0.067873985'), ('Layer (electronics)', 2, '0.0')]",S4210183352,OF

Predicting the sintering deformation of ceramic powder compacts is very important to manufactures of ceramic components. In theory the finite element method can be used to calculate the sintering deformation. In practice the method has not been used very often by the industry for a very simple reason it is more expensive to obtain the material data required in a finite element analysis than it is to develop a product through trial and error. A finite element analysis of sintering deformation requires the shear and bulk viscosities of the powder compact. The viscosities are strong functions of temperature, density and grain-size, all of which change dramatically in the sintering process. There are two ways to establish the dependence of the viscosities on the microstructure: a by using a material model and b by fitting the experimental data. The materials models differ from each other widely and it can be difficult to know which one to use. On the other hand, obtaining fitting functions is very time consuming. To overcome this difficulty, Pan and his co-workers developed a reduced finite element method Kiani et. al. J. Eur. Ceram. Soc., 2007, 27, 2377-2383; Huang and Pan, J. Eur. Ceram.

For further analysis Hf0.52Ti0.48Ox and Hf0.29Ti0.71Ox coatings, which were amorphous directly after the deposition process, were chosen,. Moreover, post-process annealing was also performed in order to compare the electrical and optical properties of amorphous and nanocrystalline thin films with the same material composition. It was found that the phase transition from amorphous to orthorhombic HfTiO4 occurred in the case of Hf0.52Ti0.48Ox coating at. In turn, the phase transition to TiO2-anatase was observed at the temperature of in the case of Hf0.29Ti0.71Ox thin film. The leakage current for both amorphous coatings was in the range of 107108A/cm2. After additional annealing and phase transition, the leakage current slightly decreased for Hf0.29Ti0.71Ox thin film, while in the case of Hf0.52Ti0.48Ox sample the resistance switching effect was observed.

The incommensurate modulated crystal structure of the hexagonal cobalt oxide Sr1.261CoO3 has been studied using a four-dimensional 4D superspace profile analysis of neutron powder diffraction data. Sr1.261CoO3 is a composite crystal that consists of the CoO3 and 2Sr subsystems. The CoO3 subsystem forms 1D chains that run parallel to the c-axis and consist of face-sharing CoO6 polyhedra with octahedral Oh and trigonal prismatic TP coordinations. The structure analysis reveals that the CoO3 chains contain 73.9% Oh and 26.1% TP sites, and that the TP sites have longer CoO bonds than the Oh sites: dav. =2.0394 TP and 1.8953 Oh. The averaged Co bond valences are Co3.563+ in the Oh sites and Co2.453+ in the TP sites, suggesting that a considerable amount of Co3+ ions are mixed with Co4+ions in the Oh sites and with Co2+ ions in the TP sites. The observed magnetic susceptibility can be well explained assuming that the compound has the Co mixed-valence state with the spin configurations of S=0 low-spin state for Co3+d6, S=1/2/ low-spin state for Co4+d5 and S=3/2/ high-spin state for Co2+d5d2. The Weiss temperature, approximately, implies that Sr1.261CoO3 naturally assumes a Curie paramagnetic state, probably owing to the obstruction of the intrachain magnetic interaction by the nonmagnetic Co3+ ions.

The growth rate of a stress corrosion crack at high stress levels is predicted on the basis that the crack-tip-opening angle CTOA depends on the growth rate d c/ d t. A functional relation between the CTOA and d c/ d t is obtained by coupling Rice, Drugan and Sham's recent theoretical results for plane strain crack growth inert environment under small-scale yielding conditions with the usual power law relation between the crack tip stress intensity K and d c/ d t. Then, by determining the CTOA at high stresses, it is in principle possible to predict the growth rate at high stresses. A major conclusion is that direct application of the K versus d c/ d t relation, its conversion to a J versus d c/ d t correlation and then the determination of J is likely to give non-conservative growth rate predictions at high stress levels in situations where J increases during crack growth. The predictions are even more non-conservative if K values are determined at high stresses, on the assumption that a K approach is directly applicable.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.8210755'), ('Growth rate', 2, '0.6553039'), ('Stress intensity factor', 3, '0.6263916'), ('Stress (linguistics)', 2, '0.60835165'), ('Crack closure', 3, '0.47874206'), ('Inert', 2, '0.44066954'), ('Plane (geometry)', 2, '0.43434626'), ('Plane stress', 3, '0.42271525'), ('Stress concentration', 3, '0.4178685'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.38591832'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.3344158'), ('Mechanics', 1, '0.32145086'), ('Fracture mechanics', 2, '0.2598482'), ('Thermodynamics', 1, '0.2564881'), ('Geometry', 1, '0.14815342'), ('Mathematics', 0, '0.1260286'), ('Finite element method', 2, '0.083975315'), ('Physics', 0, '0.061294794'), ('Linguistics', 1, '0.0'), ('Philosophy', 0, '0.0'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.0')]",S32516542,

The mechanism of decrease in the corrosion resistance of Cr-plated parts when they are subjected to a heating process and measures for preventing the degradation are studied. When postfinishing is performed after the Cr-plating process, cracks in the Cr layer are closed as a result of plastic flow on the topmost surface layer. When the residual stress in the Cr layer becomes compressive due to the postfinishing, the cracks are completely closed, resulting in a high corrosion resistance. The residual stress in the Cr layer changes from compressive to tensile following heat treatment. When the residual stress becomes tensile, the cracks in the Cr layer which were closed during postfinishing open once again, resulting in a decrease in the corrosion resistance. We speculated that the change of residual stress from compressive to tensile is caused by the shrinkage of the Cr layer due to heat treatment and the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion between the substrate steel and Cr layer, as well as the release of residual stress generated during processing. In order to prevent the decrease of corrosion resistance under heat treatment, it is effective to apply compressive stress which exceeds the level of change in residual stress due to heat treatment to the Cr layer during postfinishing, after the Cr plating process.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.91993725'), ('Corrosion', 2, '0.81986856'), ('Residual stress', 2, '0.8137989'), ('Ultimate tensile strength', 2, '0.6150255'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.6046139'), ('Layer (electronics)', 2, '0.58118355'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.54401374'), ('Compressive strength', 2, '0.48029205'), ('Stress (linguistics)', 2, '0.45169142'), ('Plating (geology)', 2, '0.41098574'), ('Philosophy', 0, '0.0'), ('Linguistics', 1, '0.0'), ('Geophysics', 1, '0.0'), ('Geology', 0, '0.0')]",S2764446333,Cr

Recent developments in plasticity modeling for crystalline materials are based on dislocations transport models, formulated for computational efficiency in terms of their densities. This leads to sets of coupled partial differential equations in a continuum description involving diffusion and convection-like processes combined with non-linearity. The properties of these equations cause the most traditional numerical methods to fail when applied to solve them. Therefore, dedicated stabilization techniques must be developed in order to obtain physically meaningful and numerically stable approximations. The objective of this paper is to present a dedicated stabilization technique and to apply it to a system of dislocation transport equations in one dimension. This stabilization technique, based on coefficient perturbations, successfully provides unconditional stability with respect to the spatial discretization.

Since water is always inseparable from human activity. The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, by valuing water vapor, has allowed the development of production capacity: Water has become an indispensable material to run the factories. Alongside this, the processes contributing to the degradation of water quality and consequently to the disruption of the entire ecosystem are increasing and intensifying. The discharge of waste water loaded with pollutants in the receiving environment without any treatment is a growing cause for concern given the adverse effects they can cause environmental and health effects. The industry of surface treatment which consists of depositing a coating on various objects by electrolytic or chemical way to give them a specific appearance and characteristics, generates waste complex because they contain pollutants such as diversified as manufacturing processes used, and may interact with separate collection is not always feasible 1. The main liquid waste from the bath surface treatment pickling baths, degreasing, and rinsing treatment, are basic or acid. They contain metal surface treatment copper, nickel, chromium, cadmium, zinc .... Some pollutants such as metals may be toxic in an immediate way to any living being. Thus the rejection of concentrated bath may be the cause of accidental pollution. This often leads to mortality of species specific lethal dose is reached 2, 3. The surface treatment is an area where the use of new technologies such as vacuum deposition may allow a significant reduction of waste streams including sludge. There are various valuation techniques such as the loss of ion exchange, cementation, the precipitation technique, reverse osmosis, ultra filtration, microfiltration 4.... They have disadvantages either to produce large volumes of waste, either to be an expensive method. Another example is the liquid-liquid extraction, the latter sometimes present problems of emulsions 5 that complicate phase separation and make it impossible or sometimes more often with loss of extractants, due to solubilization and driving the aqueous phase, as well as the use of a large amount of solvent. To address this possibility, various researchers have proposed to absorb the organic phase extractant to solid supports such as polymers 6, they are gels membranes swelled by specific hydrophobic organic extractants. The performance of this process in terms of selectivity and extraction efficiency, were very interesting. The membranes-gels are resulting from the fixation of organic extraction solvent on solid supports. The polystyrene bead form 6 or polymers of styrene-divinylbenzene, polyurethane foams, and silicone rubber were the first to be used.a result, the organic phase which was mobile in the solvent extraction system is replaced by an immobilized phase in a solid matrix. The advantages of this process are outlined as follows: Ease of implementation, low energy demand, possible restitution of the extracted specie in a new phase and a restricted volume of the organic phase. Our highest priority is the treatment of wastewater containing diluted metallic elements harmful to the environment and / or high value with low energy consumption. We are particularly interested to copper from rinse baths workshops for surface treatment.","[('Copper', 2, '0.83319414'), ('Zinc', 2, '0.7962764'), ('Extraction (chemistry)', 2, '0.64760584'), ('Membrane', 2, '0.5393941'), ('Chromatography', 1, '0.45983523'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.40267608'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.39295703'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.22860438'), ('Biochemistry', 1, '0.052286536')]",S4210175061,

Convergent beam electron diffraction CBED is a powerful technique to estimate lattice distortion and lattice strain in crystals. The positions of the higher-order Laue-zone HOLZ lines in the transmitted disc of CBED patterns are very sensitive to the lattice parameter, and can therefore be used to estimate changes in the lattice parameter. This offers the possibility to calculate lattice misfit and lattice strain. The positions of the HOLZ lines depend not only on the lattice parameter, but also on the operating voltage of the microscope. It is essential to know the actual voltage of the microscope. In the present work, 1 0 0 GaAs crystal has been used as a standard. Cross-sectional TEM specimens were prepared by argon ion beam thinning technique using a liquid nitrogen cold stage. 0 1 2 on-zone CBED technique has been used to estimate the actual voltage of the transmission electron microscope Philips EM430T TEM, when the voltage was set at 250 kV. CBED-HOLZ simulation and analyses have been done, using JEMS software, to correlate with the experimental data. The methodologies adopted for estimating the actual voltage of TEM are discussed in this paper. The studies have also been cross-checked using 0 1 2 and 2 3 3 zone axes using 1 0 0 silicon standard. The techniques established are found to be suitable foroperating at a setting voltage of about 250 kV. For the TEM studies, a regular double-tilt specimen holder is required in order to be able to get to the desired zone axes. When the experiments were repeated using a cryogenic double-tilt holder, an improvement in the sharpness of HOLZ lines was observed. Wherever possible, the use of the cryogenic double-tilt holder is recommended.

Two basic cost reducing concepts, manipulation of alloy chemistry and optimisation of the hot working process, were adopted in developing low-cost experimental titanium alloys that may be suitable for land-based applications. Iron, a low-cost beta stabilising element in titanium alloys, was used as a partial and full replacement for vanadium in ASTM grade 5 Ti6Al4V. Thermo-Calc simulations were first done on the Ti6Al-xV-yFe alloy compositions for y=4 x and x=13 to predict the amounts of phases and the -transus temperatures. Thereafter, the compacted powders of the different experimental alloys were melted and allowed to solidify in the electric arc furnace cold copper hearth. Optical and scanning electron microscopy SEM and X-ray diffraction XRD were used to characterise the alloys. Also, the hardness of the low-cost alloys was measured and compared to commercial Ti6Al4V. The Ti6Al1V3Fe alloy was subjected to hot compression testing at various temperatures 750950C and strain rates 1-10 s1 on a Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator. Processing maps and microstructural validation were used to define the most suitable processing conditions. The stress exponent and apparent activation energy were also calculated using a hyperbolic-sine equation. The results show that the low-cost alloys with partial substitution of vanadium with iron contained only -Ti and -Ti phases with no TiFe phase. The hardness of the alloys increased with increase in iron addition. The stress exponent n value was less than 5 indicating that flow softening was not solely driven by dynamic recovery. The optimum processing conditions for hot working were found at and 0.1 s1 strain rate. The alloy generally had a large processing window with the softening process controlled by mechanisms such as dynamic recovery, dynamic recrystallisation of prior beta grains, and dynamic alpha lath globularisation. In the region of and 1.510 s1 an area of unstable deformation was established which should be avoided during processing.

A clear preference over graphene due to higher gap and excellent tunability. Optical properties in visible and UV range. In this work, we perform first-principles density functional theory calculations to study siligraphene SiC3 /hexagonal boron nitride hBN vdW-heterostructures. Siligraphene has comparable electronic properties to graphene, including the presence of a Dirac-like cone, thus we investigate its potential as a replacement for graphene. We find that, when internal strains induced by the high lattice mismatch between the SiC3 and hBN layers are reduced, a very small and non-tunable gap is induced in a hybrid bilayer heterostructure. However, the picture becomes quite different when structures with higher internal strains are considered. In this scenario, the compressive strain induces a buckling in the SiC3 sheet, resulting in larger band gaps. Additionally, in many configurations, the gaps are found to be quite tunable by the application of external strains or an electrical field. Such tunability is absent in graphene/hBN heterostructures, thus giving SiC3 /hBN heterostructures a clear edge. The origin of this gap and its tunability are discussed in terms of the buckling in the SiC3 layer and the interlayer charge transfer.

Comparing with the un-doped BaSn based nanoscale materials, the SmEr-doped BnSnbased nanoscale materials exhibit higher photocatalytic activity for the gentian violet degradation. 8wt.% Sm-doped BnSnbased nanoscale materials show the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the gentian violet. 20 mL gentian violet solution concentration of 10 mgL-1 can be totally degraded using 20 mg 8wt.% Sm-doped BnSnbased nanoscale materials under the UV light illumination for 150 min. conclusion: The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the SmEr-doped BnSn based nanoscale materials can be attributed to the decreased band gap, enhanced light absorption ability and decrease of the recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. other: The SmEr-doped BnSn based nanoscale materials show enhanced photocatalytic performance towards gentian violet.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.8342073'), ('Nanorod', 2, '0.6807246'), ('Photocatalysis', 3, '0.62712777'), ('Doping', 2, '0.60592496'), ('Nanoscopic scale', 2, '0.5952552'), ('X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy', 2, '0.53145444'), ('Hydrothermal circulation', 2, '0.4718245'), ('Photoluminescence', 2, '0.42397827'), ('Nanoparticle', 2, '0.4231989'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.41859177'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.36359173'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.16854998'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.056402266'), ('Catalysis', 2, '0.05182311'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0')]",S4210200619,"BaSn,ErF3,Sm,Sm2Sn2O7,SmEr"

Increasing demands on quality of outer car panels and shortened product development processes fundamentally challenge automotive manufacturers. Development times are significantly influenced by the manufacturing process of dies, which are introduced by the time-consuming manual grinding operations carried out during die try-out. Blue color paste is often used to visualize contact areas between die surfaces and blank to provide a spotting image. The spotting image can be used to evaluate and optimize the pressure distribution. A homogeneous pressure distribution positively influences the forming process in terms of flange draw-in and surface quality. This paper presents an approach for implementing real contact areas into forming simulations based on digital spotting images of active surfaces.

Selective laser melting SLM manufactured AlSi10Mg alloys present a fine silicon-rich network and precipitates which grant high mechanical strength but low ductility. Post-treatments, aiming at eliminating inherent defects related to SLM such as residual stresses, porosity or inhomogeneity, result in significant changes in the microstructure and impact both the hardening and the damage mechanisms of the post-treated material. The present work is dedicated to the investigation of the fracture of SLM AlSi10Mg under as built and three post-treatment conditions, namely two stress relieve heat treatments and friction stir processing FSP. It is found that the interconnected Si network fosters damage at low strain due to the brittleness of the Si phase. The onset of damage transfers load to the enclosed Al phase which then fractures quickly under high stress, thus leading to low material ductility. In contrast, when the Si network is globularized into Si particles, the ductility is highly increased even in the case where the porosity and inhomogeneity of the microstructure remain after the post-treatment. The ductility enhancement results from the delay in void nucleation on the Si particles as well as from the tolerance for void growth in the Al matrix.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.56085616'), ('Laser', 2, '0.5120135'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.40799618'), ('Optics', 1, '0.18555632'), ('Physics', 0, '0.09478021')]",S154732359,"Al,AlSi10Mg,FSP,Si"

In this paper, the application of Discontinuous Deformation Analysis DDA, a powerful numerical method, to the simulation of rock mass failure problems has been discussed. It has been shown that the failure along discontinuous surfaces can be easily simulated by use of the method based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. For the failure separation of an individual block, we suggest that dense artificial meshes are made within the block, and the same strengths of the block itself are assigned to the cohesion, friction and tensile parameters of the artificial discontinuous surfaces. Then, the same algorithm as for the general discontinuities can be adopted.The new approach has been successfully applied to the simulation of a huge rock collapse at Toyohama tunnel, a very sad accident happened in Hokkaido in Feb., 1996. The collapse picture obtained from the simulation is quite in agreement with that from the spot. It is the first time that the progressive failure processes of the event are re-shown in detail.

In the present work, the giant magnetoimpedance GMI effect of Ag/NiFe plated wire was investigated at room temperature. The value of the magnetoimpedance ZHZ0/Z0 under H=90Oe can reach about 40% at 50kHz. With the increase of the field the magnetoimpedance ZHZ0/Z0 reaches a peak. The peak-field HP increases firstly with frequency f at low frequencies, and finally approaches its saturation value at frequencies f1MHz. The maximum positive-magnetoimpedance ZHPZ0/Z0 also shows a peak, which is mainly due to the reactance change. The negative- magnetoreactance decreases with increasing frequency, resulting from the reduction of permeability. In contrast, with an increase of frequency, the negative-magnetoresistance undergoes a maximum, and then drops again. The increase of magnetoresistance can be attributed to the enhancement of skin effect with frequency. The occurrence of a maximum magnetoimpedance with increasing frequency is due to the competition between the enhancement of skin effect and the reduction of permeability. There exist two intersecting points of the frequency dependence of magnetoimpedance, magnetoresistance and magnetoreactance. Both intersecting frequencies increase with applied field. The giant magnetoimpedance effect in plated wires can be very large at a relative low frequency such as 50kHz. This is correlated with the existence of the highly conductive Ag inner-core, which increases not only the effective conductivity but also the effective distance of the magnetic outer-layer NiFe from the axis of wire, reducing the effective critical frequency of skin effect.","[('Giant magnetoimpedance', 5, '0.8902117'), ('Magnetoresistance', 3, '0.7931696'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.7483372'), ('Skin effect', 2, '0.73645115'), ('Giant magnetoresistance', 4, '0.6438808'), ('Low frequency', 2, '0.55143124'), ('Magnetic field', 2, '0.5119344'), ('Permeability (electromagnetism)', 3, '0.48673204'), ('Condensed matter physics', 1, '0.48542127'), ('Conductivity', 2, '0.468897'), ('Saturation (graph theory)', 2, '0.46036'), ('Electrical conductor', 2, '0.45208234'), ('Nuclear magnetic resonance', 1, '0.376841'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.3645714'), ('Electrical engineering', 1, '0.18809405'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.108247876'), ('Physics', 0, '0.07499948'), ('Membrane', 2, '0.056799024'), ('Biochemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Mathematics', 0, '0.0'), ('Physical chemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.0'), ('Astronomy', 1, '0.0'), ('Combinatorics', 1, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0')]",S4210190818,"Ag,HP,NiFe"

Then, based on the assumption that the fatigue strength of the lap joint is dominated by the maximum tensile stress, the fatigue strength of the lap joint was estimated from the SN curve of the adhesive bonded butt joint of the thin wall tube which has a uniform stress distribution.It is confirmed that the estimated fatigue strength of the lap joint agrees well with the experimental results and, furthermore, it gives a conservative estimation.","[('Adhesive', 3, '0.7859268'), ('Joint (building)', 2, '0.73992467'), ('Lap joint', 2, '0.70125455'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.63003564'), ('Structural engineering', 1, '0.5817097'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.57724774'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.18528664'), ('Layer (electronics)', 2, '0.0')]",S2764446333,SN

In this study, the contact characteristics of p-GaN treated by laser-assisted annealing with different laser fluences were investigated. Based on the two-photon absorption model, a laser treatment on the p-GaN was achieved by utilizing laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The results showed that specific contact resistance decreased as the laser fluence increased in the low fluence region <200 mJ/cm 2 , but deteriorated when the fluence reached to 300 mJ/cm 2 or even higher, indicating that laser annealing by 532 nm could greatly affect specific contact resistance. The results of SIMS, photoluminescence spectra, and XPS measurements showed that the enhanced ohmic contact for samples with a low laser injection fluence was attributed to the enhanced aggregation of Mg atoms near the surface and the enhanced activation efficiency of MgGa acceptors by the removal of H atoms from MgH complexes. For the samples treated with fluence higher than 300 mJ/cm 2 , the contact characteristics were compromised due to both the accumulation of gallium oxide on the surface which increased the barrier height of metal/GaN and the formation of structural defects. An improved ohmic contact with a specific contact resistance of 2.93 10 4 cm 2 were demonstrated for p-GaN with the 200 mJ/cm 2 laser fluence. 532 nm laser-assisted annealing treatment has great potential for the selective activation of p-GaN and enhancement of GaN/metal contact characteristics.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.90898764'), ('Fluence', 3, '0.85576105'), ('Ohmic contact', 3, '0.81290424'), ('Contact resistance', 3, '0.736636'), ('Annealing (glass)', 2, '0.7044527'), ('Laser', 2, '0.6785743'), ('X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy', 2, '0.59473103'), ('Analytical Chemistry (journal)', 2, '0.46630728'), ('Photoluminescence', 2, '0.429725'), ('Metal', 2, '0.42798707'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.37875932'), ('Optics', 1, '0.23006845'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.19193086'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.13951239'), ('Nuclear magnetic resonance', 1, '0.065360725'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.06289545'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Layer (electronics)', 2, '0.0'), ('Chromatography', 1, '0.0')]",S82126420,"GaN,H,Mg,MgGa,MgH"

This paper aims to study the microstructure, fracture behavior, and other mechanical properties of a three-layered Al/MgLi/Al composite fabricated by the cold roll bonding CRB process. Alloying Mg with Li gave a double-phase magnesium-lithium alloy with high ductility, strengthened by bonding to two Al layers. By conducting CRB, the thickness of the composite reduced from 3 mm in the first stage to 1 mm in the last one, and in between, the mechanical and microstructural properties in five different thicknesses 2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.2, and 1 mm were investigated. Grains were elongated in the rolling direction RD according to the pictures prepared by the optical microscope, and this elongation grows as the thickness of the composite reduces. Studying the mechanical properties, including the UTS, total elongation, and fracture behavior in two directions: rolling direction and traverse direction TD, showed that UTS increases as the thickness decreases and is higher for TD samples in comparison to RD ones. Total elongation decreases by reducing the thickness, but for RD samples, it was lower than TD ones. The results show that both applied strain and thickness affect the fracture toughness simultaneously. The highest amount of fracture toughness does not belong to the sample with the highest thickness or the one that undergoes the highest strain during the CRB. For RD samples, the highest fracture toughness was recorded at the thickness of 1.6 mm, while for TD ones, it was at the thickness of 1.2 mm. SEM images of the fractured layers confirm the presence of dimples which are the reason for the ductile fracture, and this ductility reduces as the thickness goes down.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.88905674'), ('Microstructure', 2, '0.7780608'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.7337739'), ('Ductility (Earth science)', 3, '0.7296949'), ('Elongation', 3, '0.7226515'), ('Composite number', 2, '0.6897739'), ('Fracture toughness', 2, '0.5824219'), ('Fracture (geology)', 2, '0.52964973'), ('Toughness', 2, '0.52629924'), ('Ultimate tensile strength', 2, '0.38971913'), ('Creep', 2, '0.0')]",S154732359,"Al,Li,Mg,MgLi"

The effects of key processing parameters including rolling temperature, rolling speed, number of rolling passes and inter-stage annealing treatment on the deformation mechanism and recrystallization behavior of the experimental alloy were studied. At lower rolling temperature, the plastic strain applied during rolling was accommodated by the formation of twin and shear bands whereas at higher temperatures non-basal slip systems were activated resulting in the suppression of twinning and, hence, slip became the dominant deformation mechanism in such rolling conditions. The process facilitated an effective grain refinement by both dynamic and static recrystallization phenomena with an increase in the number of rolling passes and conducting inter-pass annealing stages leading to a reduction of average grain size to below 10m. Moreover, optical microscopic examinations for all the rolling conditions demonstrated that twin DRX was the major dynamic recrystallization mechanism at the beginning of the rolling process due to the large initial grain size. However, new grains were found to nucleate preferably at grain boundaries as the average grain size decreased during the hot rolling process.

EDS and AFM confirmed the composition and structure of the deposited monolayer. Thermal stability was studied using X-ray diffraction XRD, Scanning Electron Microscope SEM and four probe techniques. Results indicated that structure with barrier was stable up to whereas its counterpart could sustain only up to. Sheet resistance of Cu/SiO2 /Si structure starts increasing at and that of Cu/CoNiO/SiO2 /Si test structure was almost unchanged up to in. SEM analysis of samples annealed at different temperatures also confirmed the XRD and four probe results. Biased Thermal Stress BTS was applied to the samples and its effect was observed using CV analysis. CV curves showed that in the presence of CoNiO barrier layer there was no shift in the CV curve even after 120min of BTS while in the absence of barrier there was a significant shift in the CV curve even after 30min of BTS. Leakage current density j L was plotted against the BTS duration under same BTS conditions. It was found that the Cu/CoNiO/SiO2 /Si stack could survive about two times more than the Cu/SiO2 /Si stack.","[('Diffusion barrier', 3, '0.77438414'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.77254725'), ('Scanning electron microscope', 2, '0.7432079'), ('Analytical Chemistry (journal)', 2, '0.6643185'), ('Monolayer', 2, '0.59709704'), ('Copper', 2, '0.5215514'), ('Barrier layer', 3, '0.5204482'), ('Thermal stability', 2, '0.4623071'), ('Crystallography', 1, '0.32215685'), ('Layer (electronics)', 2, '0.21588153'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.21303305'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.12803027'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.12640512'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.079067916'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.0'), ('Chromatography', 1, '0.0')]",S82126420,"CV,CoNiO,Cu,Si,SiO2"

Titanium and its alloys are employed as artificial joints, bone plates, wires, screws and bone prostheses in orthopedic and dental fields, because of their high corrosion resistance, good mechanical properties, and biocompatibility. Since they cannot directly bond to living bonetissue through stable chemical interactions, a few surface modification techniques have been proposed for giving materials apatite-forming ability that secures bonetissue bonding, such as chemical treatment with H2O2 or NaOH, electrochemical oxidation, electrophoretic apatite particle deposition, and UV-irradiation of surface titanium oxide layer. This study examined how the combination of H2O2 chemical treatment and UV-irradiation affected in vitro apatite-formation on TiO2 anatase phase layers as UV was irradiated under a few different conditions. TiO2 layer was prepared by the chemical treatment with H2O2 solution and subsequent heat-treatment CHT. CHT samples were irradiated with UV-light for 1h in air or in ultra-pure water. They were then soaked in Kokubo's simulated body fluid SBF; pH 7.4 at for 1 day. Their surface structure and morphology were examined by using a thin film X-ray diffractometer TF-XRD, and a scanning electron microscope SEM. The UV-irradiation of CHT in air reduced the number of active sites for apatite nucleation. On the contrary, however, the UV-irradiation in water increased them. These opposite results indicate that environmental factors of the UV-irradiation are important for controlling the in vitro apatite-forming ability of anatase layer.","[('Apatite', 2, '0.9158355'), ('Simulated body fluid', 3, '0.8764211'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.68202776'), ('Biocompatibility', 2, '0.6289722'), ('Irradiation', 2, '0.62043995'), ('Anatase', 4, '0.60504496'), ('Scanning electron microscope', 2, '0.5995302'), ('Titanium', 2, '0.59711725'), ('Diffractometer', 3, '0.56626165'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.51996505'), ('Nucleation', 2, '0.44870865'), ('Nuclear chemistry', 1, '0.41612014'), ('Mineralogy', 1, '0.3227169'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.25475097'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.2415362'), ('Photocatalysis', 3, '0.20198548'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.17447963'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.10070959'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Nuclear physics', 1, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0'), ('Catalysis', 2, '0.0')]",S4210190818,"H2O2,NaOH,TiO2"

It is shown that the back stress at low strain rates is close to the OrowanAshby stress required to bypass silicide precipitates dynamically formed on mobile dislocations during creep in a titanium alloy containing small additions of silicon. At higher strain rates, when the dynamic precipitation process is not observed to occur, the back stress values appear to be close to the estimated values of the drag stress due to silicon atmospheres around moving dislocations.

Viscosities were determined using a Couette type viscometer by measuring the torque on a calibrated spindle rotating in a cylindrical alumina crucible containing the alloy composite. The thixotropic behavior of these composites was described by an analytical model where the dissociation of the primary phase particle structure is expressed in terms of a structural parameter , which depends on shear rate, duration of shear and effective solid fraction. The analytical model was applied successfully to the results of this study as well as to the results of similar studies in the literature. Observations showed that the kinetics of dissociation of this structure is strongly influenced by increasing shear rate, and decreasing fraction of primary solid phase.

The outgassing rates of various ceramic materials were systematically investigated. This paper intercompares the most relevant ceramic material classes used in vacuum technology, namely, oxide five different types investigated and non-oxide based ceramics, including nitrides four different types and carbides three different types. For this purpose, the Outgassing Measurement Apparatus, which uses the difference method, was applied. Besides time, also, temperature dependence of outgassing was studied to check whether a previous heat treatment of the ceramics is necessary. Additionally, the outgassing species were qualitatively determined by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. In total, relatively large differences were found between the investigated ceramic materials for their initial outgassing rates as well as for their behavior at elevated temperatures. All investigated types of carbide ceramics showed very low outgassing rates of less than 3 108 Pa m3/s m2 after 100 h at room temperature, whereas rather high outgassing rates of about 105 Pa m3/s m2 were found for magnesia as well as the tested nitride ceramic types.

The scanning electron microscope SEM image of MPS-SiO2 has not changed much from before the treatment, but the infrared spectrum of MPS-SiO2 shows the characteristic peak of MPS.

State-of-art perovskite photocapacitors suffer from manufacturing complexities, technical impediments and inferior PV yield and storage-to-generation ratio. To surmount these serious setbacks, technical improvements and choice of materials for various parts should be attentively addressed. Systematic manufacturing based on a seamless and practically feasible layout would solve these issues. Hence, in this article, we suggest a simple design for high-efficiency perovskite photocapacitor, integrated by stacking an asymmetric capacitor on a planar inverted multijunction PSC using CH3NH3PbI3 as photoactive layer. The capacitor portion is designed based on a solid-state dielectric layer, asymmetrically packed between two carbon electrodes. The PSC portion employs a CNT/InAlGap/InGap p-type triple-junction on PET/ITO working electrode. An ultrathin 10 nm C60 is accommodated on active layer for protection, and a 20 nmsingle-junction directly connects the capacitor to PSC, providing the synergic functions of back contact for the PSC and the cathode of the capacitor section, as explained earlier.

Tube eccentricity of the magnitude present in the tubes tested here 4% of the nominal thickness was determined to have no effect on the material response.

The production of natural fibers is not sufficient to accommodate the textile needs of the growing world population. Therefore, textile research is exploring alternative natural resources to produce fibers. Though typically known for its nutritional use, the sugarcane can also be used for textile production because of its high fiber content. The aim of our study was to extract fibers from sugarcane and to analyze their mechanical behavior. Cane particles were treated with an alkaline solution in order to get cellulosic fibers. Physical and mechanical characterizations were carried out on these fibers: linear density, fineness, tensile properties, and bending rigidity. Their microstructure was analyzed to better understand their behavior. The results showed a strong influence of extraction parameters on the characteristics of fibers. Depending on these parameters, fibers fineness ranged from 8 to 80 tex, length ranged from 19 to 62 mm, and tenacity ranged from 7 and 25 cN/tex.","[('Fineness', 2, '0.90165246'), ('Textile', 2, '0.76955414'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.6330335'), ('Ultimate tensile strength', 2, '0.6220814'), ('Fiber', 2, '0.5839962'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.53018'), ('Cellulose fiber', 3, '0.5153053'), ('Tenacity (mineralogy)', 2, '0.50723505'), ('Pulp and paper industry', 1, '0.42992178'), ('Cellulosic ethanol', 3, '0.42933732'), ('Cellulose', 2, '0.28749326'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.094055176'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.08702311')]",S4210221448,

A mass transfer model was developed to predict the performance of SO2 absorption in a chemical solvent. The model was based on solving conservation equations for gas component in the membrane. Computational fluid dynamics CFD of mass and momentum were used to solve the model equations. The simulations aimed to obtain the distribution of gas concentration in the absorption process. The effect of the operating parameters on the efficiency of the ceramic membrane was evaluated.

The use of dynamic methods in atomic force microscopy AFM has lead to spectacular advances in force measurements and imaging. There has been a gradual shift to stiffer cantilevers and smaller amplitudes, resulting in higher resolution imaging and three-dimensional force mapping. However, when amplitudes become much smaller than 1 A, they can approach the same order as the thermal noise of the cantilever.

The crack propagation process of a center cracked tension specimen was studied in pure zirconium by quasi-in-situ microstructure characterization combined with finite element modeling FEM. The microstructure characterization shows that as load increased, dislocations were emitted from crack-tip ledges and crystallographic planes were thinned by accumulation of slip traces at the crack-tip. In the near-crack region, plastic deformation was achieved mainly through dislocation motion, rather than twinning. It was observed that the crack grew along grains with plastically hard orientations as determined by the angle between c-axis and loading axis and that cleavage fracture planes were found to be non-basal. In addition, combined with the crack-tip stress field from a simulation, the Schmid factor was estimated for prismatic, basal and pyramidal slip systems at the crack tip; the results were compared with experimental determinations of geometrically necessary dislocation density.

Galvanic anodes are increasingly popular in the repair, rehabilitation, and maintenance of reinforced concrete structures suffering from chloride-induced corrosion for the added durability benefits. There is a consensus among engineers that demand will increase due to ageing infrastructure stock, climate change, and the option to reuse structures which is a logical solution to help reduce carbon emissions. New manufacturers will likely emerge to meet the needs of a growing market. However, there is no standard for galvanic anodes for use in concrete. In theory, products may come to market that fails to work as anodes, and hence corrosion may not be arrested, and repeated intervention could be required. This paper presents a methodology that has been developed for demonstrating anodes function as intended in a short-term test. Anodes were cast into concrete, and drive voltage, resistivity, and resultant current were measured when connected to an external cathode. The test setup was applied to several commercially available galvanic anodes. All anodes achieved a current output of 0.35 mA in this experimental setup. This could provide a rapid test to screen anodes new to the market. The analyses show inherent anode behaviour varied with different manufacturers, and there were also performance differences among replicate anodes. Such behavioural characteristics may affect the long-term performance of the anodes. These results provide new data on galvanic anodes and demonstrate the potential need for standardisation in the industry.","[('Anode', 3, '0.8525837'), ('Cathodic protection', 4, '0.7807245'), ('Galvanic cell', 2, '0.7096686'), ('Galvanic anode', 5, '0.70778686'), ('Corrosion', 2, '0.63497293'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.5305154'), ('Durability', 2, '0.48567736'), ('Galvanic corrosion', 3, '0.46493384'), ('Reinforced concrete', 2, '0.43073842'), ('Environmental science', 0, '0.34748805'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.2674758'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.22528228'), ('Electrode', 2, '0.11009428'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0'), ('Physical chemistry', 1, '0.0')]",S4210175061,

Deform-3D software was used to simulate the tube forming process under different extrusion ratios. It was noting that at the condition of the extrusion ratio of 2.11, the equivalent stress and strain of the extruded tube at the fixed sizing zone were obviously unevenly distributed, which was disappeared with the increase of the extrusion ratio.

Kaolinite, a clay mineral, is an important industrial mineral which was gainfully utilized with several industrial significances. Towards mineral beneficiation, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of calcination temperature on the pozzolanic activity and specific surface area of Ethiopian kaolinite Ek. The raw Ek and calcined Ek were characterized using different sophisticated techniques, such as XRD, FTIR, DSC, TGA, dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic light scattering, and SEM analysis. The pozzolanic activity and specific surface area of Ek particles were ascertained using Chapelles and BrunauerEmmettTeller methods, respectively, with some modifications. The results revealed that the calcination temperature had a great influence on pozzolanic activity and specific surface area of Ek. It was observed that the pozzolanic activity linearly increased with calcination temperature until and showed a maximal value of 1235 mg CaOH2 g1. On the other hand, beyond, the pozzolanic activity was inferred to be declined to 445 mg CaOH2 g1 at due to agglomeration of calcined kaolinite metakaolinite and formation of spinel phase. A similar phenomenon was observed for specific surface area which increased with temperature until to exhibit the maximal values of 47.794 m2g1. Further, the investigation on zeta potential analysis showed that the magnitude value of the metakaolinite was observed to be less than the zeta potential value of the raw kaolinite, which indicated that the flocculation tendency of metakaolinite was greater than the kaolinite flocculation affinity in water.","[('Kaolinite', 2, '0.89929044'), ('Calcination', 3, '0.871396'), ('Pozzolanic activity', 5, '0.76822555'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.7413801'), ('Zeta potential', 3, '0.72250503'), ('Pozzolan', 4, '0.7175449'), ('Specific surface area', 3, '0.6448574'), ('Flocculation', 2, '0.59458756'), ('Chemical engineering', 1, '0.5754121'), ('Mineralogy', 1, '0.44010803'), ('Adsorption', 2, '0.42191464'), ('Nuclear chemistry', 1, '0.34949803'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.3484063'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.18470746'), ('Cement', 2, '0.15469232'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.08105248'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.07898131'), ('Portland cement', 3, '0.0'), ('Engineering', 0, '0.0'), ('Nanoparticle', 2, '0.0'), ('Catalysis', 2, '0.0')]",S155241436,CaOH2

The wear behavior of unreinforced and reinforced 7091 Al, the latter containing either 20 vol.% SiC particulates SiC p or 20 vol.% SiC whiskers SiC w , was studied as a function of sliding distance and sliding velocity under unlubricated conditions. At sliding velocities below 1.2 m s 1 , SiC reinforcement does not affect wear resistance. Wear debris produced from both the unreinforced and reinforced materials was predominantly metallic and was small in dimension and dark in color. The mechanism of wear under these conditions was surface-fatigue-related surface cracking. At sliding velocities greater than 1.2 m s 1 , the wear rates of the reinforced materials were lower than for the unreinforced matrix. Both the unreinforced alloy and the SiC-reinforced composites exhibited elevated wear rates during the initial period of sliding, the mechanism of wear under these conditions,e high velocity and short sliding distance, being controlled by subsurface-cracking-assisted adhesive transfer and by abrasion. During steady state sliding, these elevated wear rates were maintained by the unreinforced alloy, reduced wear rates being observed in the reinforced composites. The initial wear rates of the composites depend strongly upon reinforcement orientation, the highest wear rates being observed the perpendicularly oriented SiC w composite.

The optimisation process of a vibration energy harvester is usually restricted to experimental approaches due to the lack of an analytical equation to describe the damping of a system. This study derives an analytical equation, which describes the first mode damping ratio of a clamp-free cantilever beam under harmonic base excitation by combining the transverse equation of motion of the beam with the damping-stress equation. This equation, as opposed to other common damping determination methods, is independent of experimental inputs or finite element simulations and can be solved using a simple iterative convergence method. The derived equation was determined to be correct for cases when the maximum bending stress in the beam is below the fatigue limit stress of the beam. However, an increasing trend in the error between the experiment and the analytical results were observed at high stress levels. Hence, the fatigue limit stress was used as a parameter to define the validity of the analytical equation.

The use of thermal spray stainless steel coatings for protection of low alloyed steels against different types of corrosion is limited due to high porosity levels and oxide inclusions. In this paper electrochemical methods like corrosion potential monitoring and cyclic voltammetry are reported to monitor the corrosion resistance of thermal spray coatings. The studied stainless steel AISI 316 coatings are deposited by arc spraying, plasma spraying or high velocity oxygen fuel HVOF spraying. The electrochemical tests are performed in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. It is found that none of the tested coatings had an electrochemical response equal to that of stainless steel alloy AISI 316. The results indicate that the HVOF coating has the highest corrosion resistance and the corrosion resistance of arc spray coatings can be improved by spraying in an inert argon atmosphere. The electrochemical response of the studied arc spray coatings is independent of substrate type including the case of no substrate, indicating that the underlying alloy does not contribute to the corrosion process and only the coating itself is attacked. The HVOF coatings age rapidly in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.

The principal aim of the present research work was to investigate the effects of minor additions of nickel and zirconium on the strength of cast aluminum alloy 354 at room temperature 25C. A decrease in tensile properties of 10% with the addition of 0.4 wt.% nickel is attributed to a nickel-copper reaction which interferes with the formation of Al2Cu precipitates. The platelet-like phases Al,Si3Zr,Ni,Fe and Al,Si3Zr,Ti are the main features observed in the microstructures of the tensile samples of alloys with Zr additions. The reduction in mechanical properties is due to the increase in the percentage of intermetallic phases formed during solidification; such particles would act as stress concentrators, decreasing the alloy ductility. The main effect of Zr addition lies in a significant reduction in the alloy grain size 40%, rather than an increase in the mechanical properties. Quality index charts could be used in assessing the effects of the Ni and Zr additions to the base alloy, as well as evaluating the heat treatment relationships to the alloy tensile properties, in particular when the system shows multiple precipitation reactions.

Unidirectional porous AlN ceramics UPAlNs were successfully fabricated. The combination of freeze casting and combustion synthesis is economical. The diluent content and solid loading affected the microstructure and open porosity. The UPAlNs exhibited anisotropic thermal conductivity and compressive strength. The UPAlNs have promising application prospects as catalyst supporters or filters. Unidirectional porous AlN ceramics UPAlNs have attracted great attention for their wide applications in catalyst supports, filters and composite reinforcements. However, traditional fabrication processes usually require high temperature and long production cycle. Herein, UPAlNs were successfully fabricated via the combination of tertiary butyl alcohol TBA-based freeze casting and combustion synthesis route using Al and AlN powders as raw materials. The microstructure, open porosity, thermal conductivity and compressive strength of UPAlNs can be manipulated by synergistically regulating the AlN diluent content and Al/AlN solid loading of the freezing slurries. The optimal UPAlNs exhibited controllable structure wavelength and open porosity in a wide range of 21.1-47.1 m and 54.2%-86.0%, respectively. In addition, the corresponding products also possessed anisotropic thermal conductivity and compressive strength.

Sintering of nanoparticles to create films and patterns of functional materials is emerging as a key manufacturing process in applications like flexible electronics, solar cells and thin-film devices. Further, there is the emerging potential to use nanoparticle sintering to perform additive manufacturing as well. While the effect of nanoparticle size on sintering has been well studied, very little attention has been paid to the effect of nanoparticle shape on the evolution of sintering. This paper uses Molecular dynamics MD simulations to determine the influence of particle shape on shrinkage and neck growth for two common nanoparticle shape combinations,e., sphere-sphere and sphere-cylinder nanoparticles of different sizes. These sintering indicators are examined at two different temperature ramps. The results from this work show that depending on their relative sizes, degree of neck growth and shrinkage are both significantly affected by the nanoparticle shape.

The decomposition of the motion of flexible dislocation lines in the Peierls potential of crystals into four classes of almost independent degrees of freedom is discussed and applied to the calculation of the equilibrium density of kinks in the presence of so-called geometrical kinks. The theory of the mechanical relaxation by kink-pair generation is generalised to include the effects of geometrical kinks and internal stresses. The prediction that the non-Debye features of the relaxation, e.g. the extra width of the peaks in the temperature dependence of the internal friction, should increase with decreasing measuring frequency agrees with the experiments on the Bordoni relaxation in copper. Whereas in most face-centred cubic fcc metals the kink-pair generation in dislocations with Burgers vectors a 0 1 1 0/2/ running along 1 1 0 or 1 1 2 gives rise to two rather broad relaxation peaks the Bordoni and the NiblettWilks peak, respectively, in aluminium the relaxation processes of 0-, 60-, 90-. and 30-dislocations show up in four well separated internal-friction maxima. In this sequence, they are attributed to the Bordoni peak, the subsidiary or NiblettWilks peak, the LaxFilson peak, and the KosugiKino peak. Comparison of flow-stress and internal-friction measurements on high-purity refractory body-centred cubic bcc metals confirms the interpretation of the -relaxation in terms of the kink-pair generation in a 0 1 1 1/2/ screw dislocations. The cores of these dislocations may exist in two different configurations with different slip planes, the {1 1 2} configuration being responsible for the -relaxation, the {1 1 0} configuration for the -relaxation. The existence of the two distinct core configurations may also account for the difference between the reversible and the irreversible -relaxation in niobium and tantalum and appears to be the reason for the striking dependence of the -relaxation on the temperature of deformation. It is argued that the kink-pair formation in non-screw dislocation on {1 1 0} planes gives rise to the high-temperature side of the -relaxation and that on {1 1 2} planes to the low-temperature side.","[('Dislocation', 2, '0.7702465'), ('Relaxation (psychology)', 2, '0.5630368'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.5465344'), ('Condensed matter physics', 1, '0.42261705'), ('Statistical physics', 1, '0.34972098'), ('Psychology', 0, '0.27820453'), ('Physics', 0, '0.19562066'), ('Social psychology', 1, '0.107914954'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.08000192')]",S154732359,

The reliability of flip-chip M/Sn solder joint strongly depends on Sn grain orientation, since it affects the dissolution of metal pads and the growth of intermetallic compounds. In this paper, the micro-mechanism of the effect of Sn grain orientation on the diffusion of M atom =Cu, Ni, Ag, Au or In in Sn solder joints was investigated by employing the density functional theory. The adsorption energy of M atom on Sn100 and 001 surfaces, the energy of M atom penetrating from the Sn surface to Sn body penetration energy, E pe and the energy of M atom diffusing in the bulk Sn diffusion energy were analyzed, as well as the corresponding electronic structures for different steps. It is found that the M atoms were energetically favorable at the hollow sites of Sn100 and 001 surfaces. Moreover, the adsorption energy of M/Sn100 and M/Sn001 were obtained. The M atom was more strongly adsorbed to Sn001 than to Sn100. The E pe for each M atom along a -axis of Sn grain was greater than the corresponding value that along c -axis. Moreover, the E pe increased gradually with the M atom changing from Ni to In. Electronic structure analysis shows that the E pe change can be attributed to three factors, including different atomic radius from Ni to In, difference in interatomic repulsive resistance between a and c -axis, and different hybrid orbitals between M 3 d and Sn2 p from Ni to In. At last, the results show that M atoms could migrate easily in bulk Sn.","[('Soldering', 2, '0.74324787'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.69956'), ('Substrate (aquarium)', 2, '0.6581796'), ('Mechanism (biology)', 2, '0.6120803'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.5780744'), ('Orientation (vector space)', 2, '0.561494'), ('Consumption (sociology)', 2, '0.44172546'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.40098575'), ('Geology', 0, '0.09409323'), ('Geometry', 1, '0.065956116'), ('Physics', 0, '0.056486458'), ('Social science', 1, '0.0'), ('Oceanography', 1, '0.0'), ('Mathematics', 0, '0.0'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.0'), ('Sociology', 0, '0.0')]",S26018076,"Ag,Au,Ni,Sn,Sn001,Sn100,Sn2"

The possible defect complexes and their associated reactions under stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric conditions are explored. The OFrenkel pairs are the most stable defect structure in stoichiometric zirconates, whereas the cation antisite defects are the predominant one in stoichiometric stannates. In the case of BO2 excess zirconates and stannates, the BA cation antisite defect with the A vacancy and/or the oxygen interstitial is energetically favorable, whereas the AB antisite defect together with the oxygen vacancy and/or the A interstitial is preferable under the A2O3 excess condition. Meanwhile, the maximum point defect concentrations of zirconates are much higher than those of stannates. Furthermore, the oxygen migration barriers are similar in these compounds, ranging in 0.68 eV 0.80 eV.

The stacking fault width R eq between partial dislocations within an FCC crystalline lattice characterizes the onset of numerous plastic flow mechanisms, as well as the relationship between material strength and grain size. Continuum models traditionally consider a complete unit of dislocation slip b along the 110 direction distributed between two discrete partial dislocations, each with a fixed partial Burgers vector b p , which bound a stacking fault. Across the stacking fault, the vectorial slip is assumed to be constant, yielding a constant intrinsic stacking fault energy density, isf . Here, we demonstrate that the vectorial displacement path taken in accomplishing a complete unit of slip b deviates from the expected displacement path containing the local minima, isf , leading to a correction in the nominally derived stacking fault width. The magnitude of the correction depends on both the net orientation of the dislocation within the lattice, and also the degree of relaxation of each partial Burgers vector along the 1 1 2 direction. We derive a simple analytic model for the corrected stacking fault width, explicitly accounting for the deviation, by introducing a variable 0 1, which governs the magnitude of each partial dislocation component along the 1 1 2 direction. Significantly, our model predicts a correction to R eq of O b for the nominally screw dislocation, and has no noticeable influence on nominally edge dislocations. We apply our model towards computing the stacking fault width of several FCC metals, and demonstrate excellent agreement both with our own numerical data as well as that obtained from ab initio and Molecular Statics MS methods within the literature.

Silicon carbide and graphene possess extraordinary chemical and physical properties. Here, these different systems are linked and the changes in structural and dynamic properties are investigated. For the simulations performed a classical molecular dynamic MD approach was used. In this approach, a graphene layer N = 240 atoms was grafted at different distances on top of a 6HSiC structure N = 2400 atoms and onto a-SiC structure N = 1728 atoms. The distances between the graphene and the 6H are 1.0, 1.3 and 1.5 and the distances between the graphene layer and the-SiC are 2.0, 2.3, and 2.5 . Each system has been equilibrated at room temperature until no further relaxation was observed. The 6HSiC structure in combination with graphene proves to be more stable compared to the combination with-SiC. This can be seen well in the determined energies. Pair distribution functions were influenced slightly by the graphene layer due to steric and energetic changes. This becomes clear from the small shifts of the CC distances. Interactions as well as bonds between graphene and SiC lead to the fact that small shoulders of the high-frequency SiC-peaks are visible in the spectra and at the same time the high-frequency peaks of graphene are completely absent.","[('Graphene', 2, '0.9636532'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.89983493'), ('Molecular dynamics', 2, '0.8190365'), ('Silicon carbide', 2, '0.5886425'), ('Relaxation (psychology)', 2, '0.5766519'), ('Steric effects', 2, '0.57591486'), ('Chemical physics', 1, '0.5415758'), ('Graphene nanoribbons', 3, '0.41712075'), ('Nanotechnology', 1, '0.37499678'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.22087604'), ('Computational chemistry', 1, '0.2093383'), ('Stereochemistry', 1, '0.08419499'), ('Psychology', 0, '0.0'), ('Social psychology', 1, '0.0'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0')]",S2764974331,"CC,H,HSiC,N,SiC"

ZrC is a promising candidate for the application in ultra-high temperature regime due to its unique combination of excellent properties, such as high melting point, good chemical inertness and high temperature stability. The rapid decrease of strength at high temperatures, however, is one of the obstacles that impedes its practical services. Strengthening of grain boundaries by solute segregation is believed to be an effective way to improve its high temperature performance. Therefore, the segregation tendency of ten solid solute atoms, including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Y, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, in ZrC grain boundaries, and the strengthening/weakening effects on grain boundaries due to segregation are investigated by first-principles calculations. The segregation tendency is found dominated by the size effect, which is confirmed by both a qualitative analysis and a quantitative approach based on support vector regression. It means that big atoms tend to segregate to grain boundary sites with local expansions, while small atoms tend to segregate to grain boundary sites with local compressions. Simulations on stress-strain responses indicate that segregation of small atoms Ti, V, Cr, Nb, Ta, Mo, W can usually improve grain boundary strengths by inducing compression strains to grain boundaries, even though there is also an exception. In contrast, segregation of Sc and Y will soften grain boundaries. The results reveal that strengthening of grain boundaries by solute segregation is a valuable avenue to enhance high temperature mechanical properties of ZrC, providing guidelines for further design of ZrC based materials.","[('Grain boundary', 3, '0.9091212'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.84756655'), ('Grain boundary strengthening', 4, '0.67294466'), ('Grain size', 2, '0.44697204'), ('Melting point', 2, '0.41452548'), ('Metallurgy', 1, '0.34357893'), ('Crystallography', 1, '0.34003496'), ('Condensed matter physics', 1, '0.33753613'), ('Microstructure', 2, '0.16702059'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.1556237'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.05889809'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0')]",S135187643,"Cr,Hf,Mo,Nb,Sc,Ta,Ti,W,Y,ZrC"

By optimizing the welding process parameters, the strength, hardness distribution, microstructures and fracture morphologies of the joints were analyzed in details. The experimental results showed that the joints welded by the technique had better comprehensive mechanical properties, higher tensile strength and plasticity than that of the joints obtained by other spot welding. Shear fracture of the joints was seen at the nugget instead of the HAZ, thus indicating that the strength at the HAZ is higher than that at the nugget. The plastic ring of the joint was narrower as we desired.

However, StillingerWeber potentials can only be used to model cubic crystals with the diamond-cubic structure. Here we generalize the StillingerWeber potential formulism and explore its application to other cubic crystal structures. Parameterization of this modified StillingerWeber potential is exemplified by developing potentials for four elements: Si diamond-cubic, Ni face-centered-cubic, Fe body-centered-cubic, and Po simple-cubic.

A new electrical method of investigation, constant Fermi level transient spectroscopy CFTS, is explained. It is based on MIS-H devices, an acronym that we propose to design gated Hall effect devices incorporating a 2DEG channel in an otherwise depleted heterostructure. The main characteristic of CFTS is that transients are obtained under constant potential conditions in the semiconductor and constant surface potential. This allows a rigorous theoretical analysis of capture/emission process by the interface states. This method is comparable in its spirit to feedback methods such as constant-capacitance DLTS CC-DLTS. The results obtained prove, firstly, the validity of the CFTS and, secondly, that MIS-H samples can be used both for the determination of Dit and of its energetic position within the bandgap, and thus with a good accuracy and a high level of confidence despite difficulties usually met with GaAs/dielectric interfaces.","[('Heterojunction', 2, '0.8479586'), ('Dielectric', 2, '0.7779696'), ('Semiconductor', 2, '0.6821347'), ('Interface (matter)', 4, '0.58192754'), ('Condensed matter physics', 1, '0.5657177'), ('Materials science', 0, '0.54139394'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.54086065'), ('Capacitance', 3, '0.5402569'), ('Fermi level', 3, '0.5013392'), ('Band gap', 2, '0.43477884'), ('Constant (computer programming)', 2, '0.42702335'), ('High-κ dielectric', 3, '0.42657888'), ('Physics', 0, '0.22298571'), ('Computer science', 0, '0.14407498'), ('Electrode', 2, '0.1413536'), ('Electron', 2, '0.13531026'), ('Quantum mechanics', 1, '0.090988845'), ('Capillary number', 3, '0.0'), ('Capillary action', 2, '0.0'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.0'), ('Programming language', 1, '0.0')]",S4210190818,"CC,GaAs,H"

Since Al was replaced by Cu for high-end IC products in 1997, the stability of the Cudielectric interface has become an increasingly important topic. In the dual damascene interconnect structure, Cu interconnects are surrounded by various barriers. The Cu lines are capped with a dielectric layer of materials, which is used as a diffusion barrier and an etch-stop layer. Cu migration through the capping layer is an increasingly serious concern because this layer is moving from a conventional dense material Si3N4 to lower-k barrier materials such as SiC, SiCO, and SiCN. The sidewalls of the Cu lines are encapsulated by metallic diffusion barrier materials, which also present a problem. It is increasingly more challenging to contain Cu within the interconnect lines because the aggressive shrinking of via and trench size requires thinner barrier layers. The local depletion of barrier layers may eventually expose Cu directly to the low-k interlayer dielectrics. In addition, the stability of barrier metals themselves with low-k dielectrics could also be an issue under bias-temperature stress. In any event, the stability of Cudielectric interfaces has become a pressing issue.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.58891547'), ('Dielectric', 2, '0.49110818'), ('Computer science', 0, '0.32432175'), ('Environmental science', 0, '0.32213706'), ('Optoelectronics', 1, '0.25172946')]",S4210220958,"Al,Cu,IC,Si3N4,SiC,SiCN,SiCO"

Temperature-independent elastic modulus is termed as Elinvar effect, which is available by tuning the continuous spin transition of ferromagnetic alloys via composition optimization and the first-order martensitic transformation of shape memory alloys via plastic deformation. However, these reversible mechanisms are restricted generally in a narrow temperature range of less than. Here reports, by tuning a spinodal decomposition in a TiNb-based titanium alloy via aging treatment, both the Elinvar effect in a wide temperature range of about and a high strength-to-modulus ratio of about 1.5% can be obtained by a continuous and reversible crystal ordering mechanism. The results demonstrate that the alloy aged at for 4 h has a nanoscale plate-like modulated +"" two-phase microstructure and its elastic modulus keeps almost constant from 100 to. Synchrotron and in-situ X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the crystal ordering parameter of the "" phase increases linearly with temperature from 0.88 at to 0.97 at but its volume fraction keeps a constant of about 33.8%. This suggests that the continuous ordering of the "" phase toward the high modulus phase induces a positive modulus-temperature relation to balance the negative relation of the elastically stable phase. The aged alloy exhibits a high yield strength of 1200 MPa, good ductility of 16% and a high elastic admissible strain of 1.5%. Our results provide a novel strategy to extend the Elinvar temperature range and enhance the strength by tuning the crystal ordering of decomposition alloys.","[('Materials science', 0, '0.9182096'), ('Spinodal decomposition', 3, '0.71504796'), ('Alloy', 2, '0.54879797'), ('Titanium alloy', 3, '0.54612833'), ('Spinodal', 3, '0.5196513'), ('Phase (matter)', 2, '0.51858807'), ('Diffusionless transformation', 4, '0.50343865'), ('Atmospheric temperature range', 2, '0.48766196'), ('Elastic modulus', 2, '0.4290873'), ('Microstructure', 2, '0.41256577'), ('Martensite', 3, '0.4095962'), ('Composite material', 1, '0.371288'), ('Thermodynamics', 1, '0.34220973'), ('Chemistry', 0, '0.0'), ('Physics', 0, '0.0'), ('Organic chemistry', 1, '0.0')]",S135187643,TiNb

In this paper we will review our recent results from optical characterization studies of GaInNP. We will show that N incorporation in these alloys affects their structural and defect properties, as well as the electronic structure. The main structural changes include i increasing carrier localization due to strong compositional fluctuations, which is typical for all dilute nitrides, and ii N-induced long range ordering effects, specific for GaInNP. The observed degradation of radiative efficiency of the alloys upon increasing N content is attributed to formation of several defects acting as centres of efficient non-radiative recombination. One of the defects is identified as a complex involving a Ga interstitial atom. N incorporation is also found to change the band line up from the type I in the GaInP/GaAs structures to the type II in the GaInNP/GaAs heterojunctions with N > 0.5%.

This work reports the low cycle fatigue behavior of a wrought 316LN stainless steel under different control modes at room temperature. Under symmetrical strain and stress cycling, the steel exhibits consistent loading-amplitude-dependent cyclic hardening/softening and fatigue life characteristics. Under asymmetrical stress cycling, the steel is significantly hardened due to mean stress, and the fatigue life at the same strain amplitude is significantly reduced due to ratcheting strain. With the increase of mean stress, though the ratcheting strain level is increased, the fatigue life is prolonged. The effect of mean-stress hardening and ratcheting strain on fatigue life is discussed in terms of strain amplitude and micro-crack initiation and propagation.
