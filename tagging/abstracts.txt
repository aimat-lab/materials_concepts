Review of the anatase to rutile phase transformation. Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is
an important photocatalytic material that exists as two main polymorphs, anatase
and rutile. The presence of either or both of these phases impacts on the
photocatalytic performance of the material. The present work reviews the anatase
to rutile phase transformation. The synthesis and properties of anatase and
rutile are examined, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamics of the phase
transformation and the factors affecting its observation. A comprehensive
analysis of the reported effects of dopants on the anatase to rutile phase
transformation and the mechanisms by which these effects are brought about is
presented in this review, yielding a plot of the cationic radius versus the
valence characterised by a distinct boundary between inhibitors and promoters of
the phase transformation. Further, the likely effects of dopant elements,
including those for which experimental data are unavailable, on the phase
transformation are deduced and presented on the basis of this analysis.

Review: liquid phase sintering. Liquid phase sintering LPS is a process for
forming high performance, multiple-phase components from powders. It involves
sintering under conditions where solid grains coexist with a wetting liquid.
Many variants of LPS are applied to a wide range of engineering materials.
Example applications for this technology are found in automobile engine
connecting rods and high-speed metal cutting inserts. Scientific advances in
understanding LPS began in the 1950s. The resulting quantitative process models
are now embedded in computer simulations to enable predictions of the sintered
component dimensions, microstructure, and properties. However, there are
remaining areas in need of research attention. This LPS review, based on over
2,500 publications, outlines what happens when mixed powders are heated to the
LPS temperature, with a focus on the densification and microstructure evolution
events.

Review: environmental friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials. Lead zirconate
titanate PZT based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent
piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its
compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental
friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the
European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being
considered as potentially attractive alternatives tofor specific applications.
In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on
lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structureproperty
correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium
titanate, alkali niobates ANbO3, etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-
structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is
concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses
even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the
stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current
interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of
research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article
with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already
working in this area and also draw the attention of the others.

Toughening mechanisms in elastomer-modified epoxies. Some brittle epoxies can be
toughened significantly by the addition of an elastomeric phase. A great deal of
controversy still exists on the nature of the toughening mechanisms. In this
work tensile dilatometry at constant displacement rates was used to determine
whether voiding, crazing or shear banding are the deformation mechanisms.
Diglycidyl ether-bisphenol A epoxies toughened by various levels of several
types of carboxyl-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber were studied. The
results indicate that at low strain rates the rubber particles simply enhance
shear deformation. At sufficiently high strain rates the rubber particles
cavitate and subsequently promote further shear deformation. No indication of
crazing as an important toughening mechanism is found. No significant effect of
rubber particle size or type can be ascertained.

Microcapsule induced toughening in a self-healing polymer composite.
Microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene DCPD healing agent and Grubbs' Ru catalyst
are incorporated into an epoxy matrix to produce a polymer composite capable of
self-healing. The fracture toughness and healing efficiency of this composite
are measured using a tapered double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen. Both the
virgin and healed fracture toughness depend strongly on the size and
concentration of microcapsules added to the epoxy. Fracture of the neat epoxy is
brittle, exhibiting a mirror fracture surface. Addition of DCPD-filled urea-
formaldehyde UF microcapsules yields up to 127% increase in fracture toughness
and induces a change in the fracture plane morphology to hackle markings. The
fracture toughness of epoxy with embedded microcapsules is much greater than
epoxy samples with similar concentrations of silica microspheres or solid UF
polymer particles. The increased toughening associated with fluid-filled
microcapsules is attributed to increased hackle markings as well as subsurface
microcracking not observed for solid particle fillers. Overall the embedded
microcapsules provide two independent effects: the increase in virgin fracture
toughness from general toughening and the ability to self-heal the virgin
fracture event.

Ultra-high-strength polyethylene filaments by solution spinning/drawing. This
paper deals with ultra-high-strength monofilaments of linear polyethylene that
are produced by solution spinning and subsequent hot drawing at. The influence
of the draw ratio on the mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres was
investigated. Some salient features of a polyethylene filament with a draw ratio
of 31.7 are: tensile strength at break=3.0 GPa, Young's modulus=90 GPa and DSC-
melting point at a scan speed of min1=145.5 C. The modulus was found to depend
linearly on the draw ratio. The tensile strength tended, by contrast, to
approach an upper limit at high draw ratios. Additional morphological and X-ray
studies revealed an extremely good orientation of the macromolecules in the
fibre direction of the highly drawn polyethylene monofilaments.

Toughening mechanisms in elastomer-modified epoxies. The role Of matrix
ductility on the toughenability and toughening mechanism of elastomer-modified,
diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DGEBA-based epoxies is investigated. Matrix
ductility is varied by using epoxide resins of varying epoxide monomer molecular
weights. These epoxide resins are cured using 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulphone DDS
and, in some cases, modified with 10 vol% carboxyl-terminated copolymer of
butadiene and acrylonitrile CTBN. Fracture toughness values for the neat epoxies
are found to be almost independent of the monomer molecular weight of the
epoxide resin used. However, the fracture toughness of the elastomer-modified
epoxies is found to be very dependent upon the epoxide monomer molecular weight.
Tensile dilatometry indicates that the toughening mechanism, when present, is
similar to the mechanism found for piperidine cured, elastomer-modified epoxies
studied previously. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy
techniques corroborate this finding.

Influence of particle size and particle size distribution on toughening
mechanisms in rubber-modified epoxies. The principal toughening mechanism of a
substantially toughened, rubber-modified epoxy has again been shown to involve
internal cavitation of the rubber particles and the subsequent formation of
shear bands. Additional evidence supporting this sequence of events which
provides a significant amount of toughness enhancement, is presented. However,
in addition to this well-known mechanism, more subtle toughening mechanisms have
been found in this work. Evidence for such mechanisms as crack deflection and
particle bridging is shown under certain circumstances in rubber-modified
epoxies. The occurrence of these toughening mechanisms appears to have a
particle size dependence. Relatively large particles provide only a modest
increase in fracture toughness by a particle bridging/crack deflection
mechanism. In contrast, smaller particles provide a significant increase in
toughness by cavitation-induced shear banding. A critical, minimum diameter for
particles which act as bridging particles exists and this critical diameter
appears to scale with the properties of the neat epoxy. Bimodal mixtures of
epoxies containing small and large particles are also examined and no
synergistic effects are observed.

Glass-ceramics: Their production from wastesA Review. Glass-ceramics are
polycrystalline materials of fine microstructure that are produced by the
controlled crystallisation devitrification of a glass. Numerous silicate based
wastes, such as coal combustion ash, slag from steel production, fly ash and
filter dusts from waste incinerators, mud from metal hydrometallurgy, different
types of sludge as well as glass cullet or mixtures of them have been considered
for the production of glass-ceramics. Developments of glass-ceramics from waste
using different processing methods are described comprehensively in this review,
covering R&D work carried out worldwide in the last 40 years. Properties and
applications of the different glass-ceramics produced are discussed. The review
reveals that considerable knowledge and expertise has been accumulated on the
process of transformation of silicate waste into useful glass-ceramic products.
These glass-ceramics are attractive as building materials for usage as
construction and architectural components or for other specialised technical
applications requiring a combination of suitable thermo-mechanical properties.
Previous attempts to commercialise glass-ceramics from waste and to scale-up
production for industrial exploitation are also discussed.

Ceramic matrix composites containing carbon nanotubes. Due to the remarkable
physical and mechanical properties of individual, perfect carbon nanotubes they
are considered to be one of the most promising new reinforcements for structural
composites. Their impressive electrical and thermal properties also suggest
opportunities for multifunctional applications. In the context of inorganic
matrix composites, researchers have particularly focussed onas toughening
elements to overcome the intrinsic brittleness of the ceramic or glass material.
Although there are now a number of studies published in the literature, these
inorganic systems have received much less attention than CNT/polymer matrix
composites. This paper reviews the current status of the research and
development of CNT-loaded ceramic matrix composite CMC materials. It includes a
summary of the key issues related to the optimisation of CNT-based composites,
with particular reference to brittle matrices and provides an overview of the
processing techniques developed to optimise dispersion quality, interfaces, and
density. The properties of the various composite systems are discussed, with an
emphasis on toughness; a comprehensive comparative summary is provided, together
with a discussion of the possible toughening mechanism that may operate. Last, a
range of potential applications are discussed, concluding with a discussion of
the scope for future developments in the field.

Overview of transient liquid phase and partial transient liquid phase bonding.
Transient liquid phase TLP bonding is a relatively new bonding process that
joins materials using an interlayer. On heating, the interlayer melts and the
interlayer element or a constituent of an alloy interlayer diffuses into the
substrate materials, causing isothermal solidification. The result of this
process is a bond that has a higher melting point than the bonding temperature.
This bonding process has found many applications, most notably the joining and
repair of Ni-based superalloy components. This article reviews important aspects
of TLP bonding, such as kinetics of the process, experimental details bonding
time, interlayer thickness and format, and optimal bonding temperature, and
advantages and disadvantages of the process. A wide range of materials that TLP
bonding has been applied to is also presented. Partial transient liquid phase
PTLP bonding is a variant of TLP bonding that is typically used to join
ceramics. PTLP bonding requires an interlayer composed of multiple layers; the
most common bond setup consists of a thick refractory core sandwiched by thin,
lower-melting layers on each side. This article explains how the experimental
details and bonding kinetics of PTLP bonding differ from TLP bonding. Also, a
range of materials that have been joined by PTLP bonding is presented.

The toughness of epoxy polymers and fibre composites modified with rubber
microparticles and silica nanoparticles. The present paper investigates the
effect of adding silica nanoparticles to an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer in
bulk and when used as the matrix of carbon- and glass-fibre reinforced
composites. The formation of hybrid epoxy polymers, containing both silica
nanoparticles and carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile CTBN rubber
microparticles, is also discussed. The structure/property relationships are
considered, with an emphasis on the toughness and the toughening mechanisms. The
fracture energy of the bulk epoxy polymer was increased from 77 to 212J/m2 by
the presence of 20wt% of silica nanoparticles. The observed toughening
mechanisms that were operative were a plastic shear-yield bands, and b debonding
of the matrix from the silica nanoparticles, followed by plastic void-growth of
the epoxy. The largest increases in toughness observed were for the hybrid
materials. Here a maximum fracture energy of 965J/m2 was measured for a hybrid
epoxy polymer containing 9wt% and 15wt% of the rubber microparticles and silica
nanoparticles, respectively. Most noteworthy was the observation that these
increases in the toughness of the bulk polymers were found to be transferred to
the fibre composites. Indeed, the interlaminar fracture energies for the fibre-
composite materials were increased even further by a fibre-bridging toughening
mechanism. The present work also extends an existing model to predict the
toughening effect of the nanoparticles in a thermoset polymer. There was
excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the
epoxy containing the silica nanoparticles, and for epoxy polymers containing
micrometre-sized glass particles. The latter, relatively large, glass particles
were investigated to establish whether a nano-effect, with respect to increasing
the toughness of the epoxy bulk polymers, did indeed exist.

key issue. Supercapacitors, as one important energy storage device, have gained
much attention and owned a wide range of applications by taking advantages of
micro-size, lightweight, high power density and long cycle life. From this
perspective, numerous studies, especially on electrode materials, have been
reported and great progress in the advancement in both the fundamental and
applied fields of supercapacitor has been achieved. Herein, a review of recent

The preparation and characterization of alumina membranes with ultra-fine pores.
Alumina films less than 20m thick are prepared by a process in which a boehmite
sol is successively gelled, dried and calcined. The resulting structure has the
unique property that only ultra-fine pores with a narrow pore size distribution
are present within large crack-free layers. The microstructure can be influenced
by the sintering temperature and the acid concentration of the precursor sol.
The minimum modal pore size which has been obtained is 2.5 nm. A consistent

Investigation on magnetorheological elastomers based on natural rubber.
Magnetorheological Elastomers MR Elastomers orare a kind of novel smart
material, whose mechanical, electrical, magnetic properties are controllable
under applied magnetic fields. They have attracted increasing attentions and
broad application prospects. But conventionalare limited to wide applications
because their MR effects and mechanical performances are not high enough. This
paper aims to optimize the fabrication method and to fabricate good natural
rubber basedwith high modulus by investigating the influences of a variety of
fabrication conditions on theperformances, such as matrix type, external
magnetic flux density, and temperature, plasticizer and iron particles. Among
these factors, the content of iron particles plays a most important contribution
in shear modulus. When the iron particle weight fraction is 80% and the external
magnetic flux density is 1 T, the field-induced increment of shear modulus
reaches 3.6 MPa, and the relative MR effect is 133%. If the iron weight fraction
increases to 90%, the field-induced increment of shear modulus is 4.5 MPa. This
result has exceeded the best report in the literatures researching theon the
same kind of matrix. The dynamic performances ofwere also experimentally
characterized by using a modified Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer DMA system. The
effects of strain amplitude and driving frequency on viscoelastic properties

A review of wetting versus adsorption, complexions, and related phenomena: the
rosetta stone of wetting. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts and the
terminology of wetting. In particular, it focuses on high temperature wetting
phenomena of primary interest to materials scientists. We have chosen to split
this review into two sections: one related to macroscopic continuum definitions
and the other to a microscopic or atomistic approach, where the role of
chemistry and structure of interfaces and free surfaces on wetting phenomena are
addressed. A great deal of attention has been placed on thermodynamics. This
allows clarification of many important features, including the state of
equilibrium between phases, the kinetics of equilibration, triple lines,
hysteresis, adsorption segregation and the concept of complexions, intergranular
films, prewetting, bulk phase transitions versus interface transitions, liquid
versus solid wetting, and wetting versus dewetting.

Performing elemental microanalysis with high accuracy and high precision by
scanning electron microscopy/silicon drift detector energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometry SEM/SDD-EDS. Electron-excited X-ray microanalysis performed in the
scanning electron microscope with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry EDS is a
core technique for characterization of the microstructure of materials. The
recent advances in EDS performance with the silicon drift detector SDD enable
accuracy and precision equivalent to that of the high spectral resolution
wavelength-dispersive spectrometer employed on the electron probe microanalyzer
platform. SDD-EDS throughput, resolution, and stability provide practical
operating conditions for measurement of high-count spectra that form the basis
for peak fitting procedures that recover the characteristic peak intensities
even for elemental combination where severe peak overlaps occur, such PbS, MoS2,
BaTiO3, SrWO4, and WSi2. Accurate analyses are also demonstrated for
interferences involving large concentration ratios: a major constituent on a
minor constituent Ba at 0.4299 mass fraction on Ti at 0.0180 and a major
constituent on a trace constituent Ba at 0.2194 on Ce at 0.00407; Si at 0.1145
on Ta at 0.0041. Accurate analyses of low atomic number elements, C, N, O, and
F, are demonstrated. Measurement of trace constituents with limits of detection
below 0.001 mass fraction 1000 ppm is possible within a practical measurement
time of 500 s.

Principles of superplasticity in ultrafine-grained materials. Ultrafine-grained
materials are attractive for achieving superplastic elongations provided the
grains are reasonably stable at elevated temperatures. Since the strain rate in
superplasticity varies inversely with the grain size raised to a power of two, a
reduction in grain size to the submicrometer level leads to the occurrence of
superplastic flow within the region of high strain rate superplasticity at
strain rates >102 s1. This paper tabulates and examines the various reports of
superplasticity in ultrafine-grained materials. It is shown that these materials
exhibit many characteristics similar to conventional superplastic alloys
including strain rates that are consistent with the standard model for
superplastic flow and the development of internal cavitation during the flow
process.

The effect of carbon nanotubes on the fracture toughness and fatigue performance
of a thermosetting epoxy polymer. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes, with a typical
length of 140m and a diameter of 120nm, have been used to modify an anhydride-
cured epoxy polymer. The modulus, fracture energy and the fatigue performance of
the modified polymers have been investigated. Microscopy showed that these long
nanotubes were agglomerated, and that increasing the nanotube content increased
the severity of the agglomeration. The addition of nanotubes increased the
modulus of the epoxy, but the glass transition temperature was unaffected. The
measured fracture energy was also increased, from 133 to 223J/m2 with the
addition of 0.5wt% of nanotubes. The addition of the carbon nanotubes also
resulted in an increase in the fatigue performance. The threshold strain-energy
release-rate, G th, increased from 24J/m2 for the unmodified material to 73J/m2
for the epoxy with 0.5wt% of nanotubes. Electron microscopy of the fracture
surfaces showed clear evidence of nanotube debonding and pull-out, plus void
growth around the nanotubes, in both the fracture and fatigue tests. The
modelling study showed that the modified HalpinTsai equation can fit very well
with the measured values of the Youngs modulus, when the orientation and
agglomeration of the nanotubes are considered. The fracture energy of the
nanotube-modified epoxies was predicted, by considering the contributions of the
toughening mechanisms of nanotube debonding, nanotube pull-out and plastic void
growth of the epoxy. This indicated that debonding and pull-out contribute to
the toughening effect, but the contribution of void growth is not significant.
There was excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental
results.

Effect of filler size and concentration on the structure and properties of
polyvinylidene fluoride/BaTiO3 nanocomposites. The effect of filler size and
content in the thermal, mechanical, and electrical response of polyvinylidene
fluoride PVDF/BaTiO3 nanocomposites has been investigated. Dielectric constant
increases significantly with increasing filler content and decreasing filler
size. Space charge effects at the interface between BaTiO3 and PVDF strongly
influence the dielectric response. The electroactive -phase of PVDF is nucleated
by the presence of the ceramic filler, the effect being strongly dependent on
filler size and independent on filler content. This filler/matrix interaction is
also responsible for the variations observed in the activation energy of the
thermal degradation of the polymer. Smaller particles lead to larger relative
contact areas and are responsible for the main variations observed in the
thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties of the composites.

Thermal conductivity of carbon nanotube networks: a review. Depending on their
structure and order individual, films, bundled, buckypapers, etc., carbon
nanotubesdemonstrate different values of thermal conductivity, from the level of
thermal insulation with the thermal conductivity of 0.1W/mK to such high values
as 6600W/mK. This review article concentrates on analyzing the articles on
thermal conductivity of CNT networks. It describes various measurement methods,
such as the 3- method, bolometric, steady-state method and their variations,
hot-disk method, laser flash analysis, thermoreflectance method and Raman
spectroscopy, and summarizes the results obtained using those techniques. The
article provides the main factors affecting the value of thermal conductivity,
such as CNT density, number of defects in their structure, CNT ordering within
arrays, direction of measurement in relation to their length, temperature of
measurement and type of The practical methods of using CNT networks and the
potential directions of future research in that scope were also described.

Understanding and mitigating hydrogen embrittlement of steels: a review of
experimental, modelling and design progress from atomistic to continuum.
Hydrogen embrittlement is a complex phenomenon, involving several length- and
timescales, that affects a large class of metals. It can significantly reduce
the ductility and load-bearing capacity and cause cracking and catastrophic
brittle failures at stresses below the yield stress of susceptible materials.
Despite a large research effort in attempting to understand the mechanisms of
failure and in developing potential mitigating solutions, hydrogen embrittlement
mechanisms are still not completely understood. There are controversial opinions
in the literature regarding the underlying mechanisms and related experimental
evidence supporting each of these theories. The aim of this paper is to provide
a detailed review up to the current state of the art on the effect of hydrogen
on the degradation of metals, with a particular focus on steels. Here, we
describe the effect of hydrogen in steels from the atomistic to the continuum
scale by reporting theoretical evidence supported by quantum calculation and
modern experimental characterisation methods, macroscopic effects that influence
the mechanical properties of steels and established damaging mechanisms for the
embrittlement of steels. Furthermore, we give an insight into current approaches
and new mitigation strategies used to design new steels resistant to hydrogen
embrittlement.

A review of the synthesis and characterization of anion exchange membranes. This
review highlights advancements made in anion exchange membrane AEM head groups,
polymer structures and membrane synthesis methods. Limitations of current
analytical techniques for characterizingare also discussed. AEM research is
primarily driven by the need to develop suitablefor the high-pH and high-
temperature environments in anion exchange membrane fuel cells and anion
exchange membrane water electrolysis applications. AEM head groups can be
broadly classified as nitrogen based e.g. quaternary ammonium, nitrogen free
e.g. phosphonium and metal cations e.g. ruthenium. Metal cation head groups show
great promise for AEM due to their high stability and high valency. Through
rational polymer architecture, it is possible to synthesizewith ion channels and
improved chemical stability. Heterogeneous membranes using porous supports or
inorganic nanoparticles show great promise due to the ability to tune membrane
characteristics based on the ratio of polymer to porous support or
nanoparticles. Future research should investigate consolidating advancements in
AEM head groups with an optimized polymer structure in heterogeneous membranes
to bring together the valuable characteristics gained from using head groups
with improved chemical stability, with the benefits of a polymer structure with
ion channels and improved membrane properties from using a porous support or
nanoparticles.

course of the extrusion process. For the three alloys, the grain size in the

The HallPetch and inverse HallPetch relations and the hardness of
nanocrystalline metals. We review some of the factors that influence the
hardness of polycrystalline materials with grain sizes less than 1 m. The
fundamental physical mechanisms that govern the hardness of nanocrystalline
materials are discussed. The recently proposed dislocation curvature model for
grain size-dependent strengthening and the 60-year-old HallPetch relationship
are compared. For grains less than 30 nm in size, there is evidence for a
transition from dislocation-based plasticity to grain boundary sliding,
rotation, or diffusion as the main mechanism responsible for hardness. The
evidence surrounding the inverse HallPetch phenomenon is found to be
inconclusive due to processing artefacts, grain growth effects, and errors
associated with the conversion of hardness to yield strength in nanocrystalline
materials.

Glassceramic glazes for ceramic tiles: a review. Glassceramics are ceramic
materials produced through controlled crystallisation nucleation and crystal
growth of a parent glass. The great variety of compositions and the possibility
of developing special microstructures with specific technological properties
have allowed glassceramic materials to be used in a wide range of applications.
One field for which glassceramics have been developed over the past two decades
is that of glazes for ceramic tiles. Ceramic tiles are the most common building
material for floor and wall coverings in Mediterranean countries. Glazed tiles
are produced from frits glasses quenched in water applied on the surface of
green tiles and subjected to a firing process. In the 1990s, there was growing
interest in the development of frits that are able to crystallise on firing
because of the need for improvement in the mechanical and chemical properties of
glazed tiles. This review offers an extensive evaluation of the research carried
out on glassceramic glazes used for covering and pavement ceramic tile is
accomplished. The main crystalline phases silicates and oxides developed in
glassceramic glazes have been considered. In addition, a section focused on
glazes with specific functionality photocatalytic, antibacterial and antifungal
activity, or aesthetic superficial effects is also included.

Additive manufacturing of steels: a review of achievements and challenges. Metal
additive manufacturing AM, also known as 3D printing, is a disruptive
manufacturing technology in which complex engineering parts are produced in a
layer-by-layer manner, using a high-energy heating source and powder, wire or
sheet as feeding material. The current paper aims to review the achievements in
AM of steels in its ability to obtain superior properties that cannot be
achieved through conventional manufacturing routes, thanks to the unique
microstructural evolution in AM. The challenges that AM encounters are also
reviewed, and suggestions for overcoming these challenges are provided if
applicable. We focus on laser powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition
as these two methods are currently the most common AM methods to process steels.
The main foci are on austenitic stainless steels and maraging/precipitation-
hardened PH steels, the two so far most widely used classes of steels in AM,
before summarising the state-of-the-art of AM of other classes of steels. Our
comprehensive review highlights that a wide range of steels can be processed by
AM. The unique microstructural features including hierarchical subgrains and
fine precipitates induced by AM result in enhancements of strength, wear
resistance and corrosion resistance of AM steels when compared to their
conventional counterparts. Achieving an acceptable ductility and fatigue
performance remains a challenge in AM steels. AM also acts as an intrinsic heat
treatment, triggering in situ phase transformations including tempering and
other precipitation phenomena in different grades of steels such as PH steels
and tool steels. A thorough discussion of the performance of AM steels as a
function of these unique microstructural features is presented in this review.

Solvothermal reactions: an original route for the synthesis of novel materials.
Twenty years after the first development of solvothermal reactions, it appears
important through the last research activities to trace the future trends taking
into account their potentialities and the different economical constraints.
During these last 20 years solvothermal reactions have been mainly used from
preparing micro- or nanoparticles with different morphologies. Due to the
importance to dispose of new materials for developing either basic research or
industrial applications, such a presentation will be only focussed on the
potentialities of solvothermal reactions in materials synthesis. Solvothermal
reactions are mainly characterized by different chemical parameters nature of
the reagents and of the solvent and thermodynamical parameters in particular
temperature, pressure. a The selection of the composition of the solvent opens
new research areas for stabilizing materials belonging to different classes of
materials alloys, oxides, nitrides, sulphides. b The mild temperature conditions
generally used are able to improve chemical diffusion and reactivity in order to
help the preparation of specific materials at the frontier between either
different classes of inorganic materials oxides-nitrides, nitrides-halides or
inorganic/organic, inorganic/biologic frameworks. c The high pressure
conditions, due to the small conveyed energy compared to temperature, allow also
to stabilize metastable frontier materials geo-inspired or bio-inspired
materials. d In the future, taking into account, from one side: the economical
and the environmental constraints, and from the other: the industrial demand of
materials characterized by specific physical, chemical and biological
properties, the potential developments of solvothermal processes will be
analyzed.

Properties of magnesium alloys reinforced with nanoparticles and carbon
nanotubes: a review. Magnesium alloys suffer from only moderate high-temperature
strength and creep resistance. Aluminium-free magnesium alloys for sand casting
or alloys containing aluminium with expensive additional alloying elements may
be in use, but only microparticle or microfibre-reinforced magnesium alloys
really exhibit satisfactory creep strengths at temperatures up to. Reinforcing
magnesium alloys with ceramic nanoparticles could be a solution for preserving a
low density while increasing the high-temperature performance. When produced
using melting processes, nanoparticle-reinforced magnesium composites are
expected to enjoy strengthening due to the grain refinement described in the
HallPetch relation. When an isotropic distribution of nanoparticles is achieved,
the composites are additionally expected to be Orowan-strengthened. In this
review, a variety of ceramic materials, such as SiC, Al2O3, Y2O3, SiO2 and
carbon nanotubes were investigated for reinforcement. Pure magnesium and various
magnesium alloys were chosen as the matrix material and both powder
metallurgical PM and melting processes were used for production of the
composites. The mechanical properties of the composites were generally enhanced,
compared to an unreinforced alloy; not only at room temperature, but also at
elevated temperatures. In some cases an increase in strength in combination with
increased ductility was also identified.

The mechanical properties and fracture behaviour of epoxy-inorganic micro- and
nano-composites. Hybrid materials have been formed using an epoxy polymeric
matrix and a range of inorganic particles, including mica and organically-
modified montmorillonites organoclays, with various concentrations of the
silicate modifier up to about 30 wt.% depending upon the viscosity increase
induced by the presence of the silicate. Wide-angle and small-angle X-ray
scattering plus transmission electron microscopy were used to identify the
morphologies produced, which included particulate, intercalated and ordered
exfoliated. The modulus of these composites increased with the weight fraction
of silicate. The morphology had a small effect on the measured modulus; the
nano-composites with the ordered exfoliated microstructure showing the highest
values of the modulus for a given volume fraction of silicate. The fracture
toughness, Kc, and the fracture energy, Gc, initially increased as the weight
fraction of the silicate was increased, but then decreased at relatively high
concentrations. The measured moduli and toughnesses were compared to theoretical
predictions. The measured moduli values showed very good agreement with the
predicted values, whilst the agreement for values of the measured fracture
energy, Gc, with the predicted values, based upon a crack deflection toughening
mechanism, were less convincing. Indeed, analysis of the fracture surfaces using
scanning electron microscopy showed that the main toughening effect of the
silicate particles is due to plastic deformation of the epoxy matrix around the
particles.

Mechanical properties of banana fibres Musa sepientum. The stressstrain curve
for banana fibre is determined. Properties such as the initial modulus YM,
ultimate tensile strength UTS and percentage elongation are evaluated as a
function of fibre diameter, test length and speed of testing. It is found that
YM, UTS and % elongation show little variation in their values for fibres of
diameter ranging from 50 to 250 m. The UTS and breaking strain are found to
decrease with an increase in the test length while both breaking strength and
breaking strain remain constant with the increase of speed of testing from 0.5
to 100 103 m and thereafter they both decrease. These observed properties are
explained on the basis of the internal structure of the fibre, namely, the
number of cells, spiral angle and the number of defects. Scanning electron
microscopic SEM studies of the fractured surfaces of these fibres indiacte that
the failure is due to pull-out of microfibrils accompanied by tearing of cell
walls; the tendency for fibre pull-out seems to decrease with increasing speed
of testing.

From the computer to the laboratory: materials discovery and design using first-
principles calculations. The development of new technological materials has
historically been a difficult and time-consuming task. The traditional role of
computation in materials design has been to better understand existing
materials. However, an emerging paradigm for accelerated materials discovery is
to design new compounds in silico using first-principles calculations, and then
perform experiments on the computationally designed candidates. In this paper,
we provide a review of ab initio computational materials design, focusing on
instances in which a computational approach has been successfully applied to
propose new materials of technological interest in the laboratory. Our examples
include applications in renewable energy, electronic, magnetic and multiferroic
materials, and catalysis, demonstrating that computationally guided materials
design is a broadly applicable technique. We then discuss some of the common
features and limitations of successful theoretical predictions across fields,
examining the different ways in which first-principles calculations can guide
the final experimental result. Finally, we present a future outlook in which we
expect that new models of computational search, such as high-throughput studies,
will play a greater role in guiding materials advancements.

Fatigue crack propagation in microcapsule-toughened epoxy. The addition of
liquid-filled urea-formaldehyde UF microcapsules to an epoxy matrix leads to
significant reduction in fatigue crack growth rate and corresponding increase in
fatigue life. Mode-I fatigue crack propagation is measured using a tapered
double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen for a range of microcapsule concentrations
and sizes: 0, 5, 10, and 20% by weight and 50, 180, and 460 m diameter. Cyclic
crack growth in both the neat epoxy and epoxy filled with microcapsules obeys
the Paris power law. Above a transition value of the applied stress intensity
factor K T, which corresponds to loading conditions where the size of the
plastic zone approaches the size of the embedded microcapsules, the Paris law
exponent decreases with increasing content of microcapsules, ranging from 9.7
for neat epoxy to approximately 4.5 for concentrations above 10 wt%
microcapsules. Improved resistance to fatigue crack propagation, indicated by
both the decreased crack growth rates and increased cyclic stress intensity for
the onset of unstable fatigue-crack growth, is attributed to toughening
mechanisms induced by the embedded microcapsules as well as crack shielding due
to the release of fluid as the capsules are ruptured. In addition to increasing
the inherent fatigue life of epoxy, embedded microcapsules filled with an
appropriate healing agent provide a potential mechanism for self-healing of
fatigue damage.

XPS and FT-IR investigation of silicate polymers. This article presents the
results of an investigation of the compositional and structural features of an
inorganic polymer synthesized from amorphous silica and KOH. The inorganic
polymers were characterized using Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy
FT-IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, scanning electron microscopy SEM
and X-ray diffraction XRD. FT-IR investigation of the inorganic polymers showed
that an increase in the hydroxide concentration used in the synthesis shifts the
position of the maximum absorbance of SiO bands toward lower wave numbers,
indicating the transformation of Q4 units to Q3 and Q2 units. XPS investigation
of the inorganic polymers showed that the total amount of oxygen and potassium
present in the sample increased when higher concentrations of hydroxide were
used in the synthesis. The O/Si ratio of the inorganic polymers changed from 2
to 2.6 when the KOH concentration was increased from 0.75 to 4 M. The increase
in the O/Si ratio can be explained by the greater dissolution of SiO2 particles
leading to the formation of branched polymers and gelation.

Materials development for intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrochemical

outstanding performance at reduced intermediate temperatures 500700 C,
increasing the durability and lowering the cost of the device. A solid-state
electrochemical cell is in outline a simple device consisting of three
components: anode, electrolyte and cathode. The function of each component is
critical to cell performance, and as interest in fuel cells and electrolysers
has gathered pace, many materials have been evaluated as functional components

been the drive to lower operation temperature, overcoming sluggish reaction
kinetics in existing materials. Novel materials for the functional components of

A review of low-temperature plasma treatment of textile materials. In recent
years, plasma treatment technology has attracted more attention in the textile
industry, as it seems to be a promising economically and ecologically sound
alternative to conventional wet-chemical processing techniques. Plasma surface
treatment is a relatively simple process that is clean, solvent-free, time
saving, and environmentally friendly. Moreover, plasma treatments offer the
possibility to obtain typical textile finishes without changing the key textile
properties. The efficiency of plasma treatment depends on several factors
including the nature of the substrate and the treatment operating conditions.
However, the application of plasma technology to different kinds of textile
materials has not been fully exploited. This paper presents a review of the

plasma LTP technology. Its main objectives are to i investigate the influence of
LTP treatment on the surface properties of natural and man made textile
materials, ii outline the contribution of LTP treatment towards sustainable

Recent developments in the preparation, characterization and applications of
glass- and glassceramic-to-metal seals and coatings. There has, in recent years,
been a major revival of interest in glass- and glassceramic-to-metal seals and
coatings for new applications. Experience dictates that many factors need to be
taken into consideration in the successful design and manufacture of high-
quality seals, particularly if an adequate component lifetime is to be achieved.
For example, during their preparation, undesirable reactions may occur between
diffusing metal species and glass constituents, and these can lead to the
formation of highly localized internal stresses, which can initiate failure of a
seal either during manufacture or, more seriously, whilst in service due to the
influence of static fatigue. In the case of high-temperature systems, reactions
under hostile operating conditions also need to be taken into consideration. In
this review, the factors learnt from past experience that influence the
formation and lifetime behaviour of glass and glassceramic/metal systems are
briefly introduced, and their relevance to the newer applications including
solid oxide fuel cell sealants and coatings on titanium for biomedical
applications is discussed.

Drying-induced changes in the structure of alkali-activated pastes. Drying of
cement paste, mortar, or concrete specimens is usually required as a pre-
conditioning step prior to the determination of permeability-related properties
according to standard testing methods. The reaction process, and consequently
the structure, of an alkali-activated slag or slag/fly ash blend geopolymer
binder differs from that of Portland cement, and therefore there is little
understanding of the effects of conventional drying methods as applied to
Portland cements on the structure of the geopolymer binders. Here, oven drying
60 C, acetone treatment, and desiccator/vacuum drying are applied to sodium
silicate-activated slag and slag/fly ash geopolymer pastes after 40 days of
curing. Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction, infrared
spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and nitrogen sorption shows that the acetone
treatment best preserves the microstructure of the samples, while oven drying
modifies the structure of the binding gels, especially in alkali-activated slag
paste where it notably changes the pore structure of the binder. This suggests
that the pre-conditioned drying of alkali activation-based materials strongly
affects their microstructural properties, providing potentially misleading
permeability and durability parameters for these materials when pre-conditioned
specimens are used during standardized testing.

The role of carbon segregation on nanocrystallisation of pearlitic steels
processed by severe plastic deformation. The nanostructure and the carbon
distribution in a pearlitic steel processed by torsion under high pressure was
investigated by three-dimensional atom probe. In the early stage of deformation
shear strain of 62, off-stoichiometry cementite was analysed close to interphase
boundaries and a strong segregation of carbon atoms along dislocation cell
boundaries was observed in the ferrite. At a shear strain of 300, only few
nanoscaled off-stoichiometry cementite particles remain and a nanoscaled
equiaxed grain structure with a grain size of about 20 nm was revealed. 3D-AP
data clearly point out a strong segregation of carbon atoms along grain
boundaries. The influence of this carbon atom segregation on the nanostructure
formation is discussed and a scenario accounting for the nanocrystallisation
during severe plastic deformation is proposed.

An investigation of the mechanisms for strength gain or loss of geopolymer
mortar after exposure to elevated temperature. When fly ash-based geopolymer
mortars were exposed to a temperature of, it was found that the strength after
the exposure sometimes decreased, but at other times increased. This paper shows
that ductility of the mortars has a major correlation to this strength gain/loss
behaviour. Specimens prepared with two different fly ashes, with strengths
ranging from 5 to 60MPa, were investigated. Results indicate that the strength
losses decrease with increasing ductility, with even strength gains at high
levels of ductility. This correlation is attributed to the fact that mortars
with high ductility have high capacity to accommodate thermal incompatibilities.
It is believed that the two opposing processes occur in mortars: 1 further
geopolymerisation and/or sintering at elevated temperatures leading to strength
gain; 2 the damage to the mortar because of thermal incompatibility arising from
non-uniform temperature distribution. The strength gain or loss occurs depending
on the dominant process.

Grain size effect on deformation twinning and detwinning. This article
systematically overviews the grain size effect on deformation twinning and
detwinning in face-centered cubic fcc metals. With decreasing grain size,
coarse-grained fcc metals become more difficult to deform by twinning, whereas
nanocrystalline nc fcc metals first become easier to deform by twinning and then
become more difficult, exhibiting an optimum grain size for twinning. The
transition in twinning behavior from coarse-grained to nc fcc metals is caused
by the change in deformation mechanisms. An analytical model based on observed
deformation physics in nc metals,e., grain boundary emission of dislocations,
provides an explanation of the observed optimum grain size for twinning in nc
fcc metals. The detwinning process is caused by the interaction between
dislocations and twin boundaries. Under a certain deformation condition, there
exists a grain size range where the twinning process dominates over the
detwinning process to produce the highest density of twins.

Activation energy determination for linear heating experiments: deviations due
to neglecting the low temperature end of the temperature integral. Model-free
isoconversion methods which use approximations of the temperature integral are
generally reliable methods for the calculation of activation energies of
thermally activated reactions studied during linear heating. These methods
generally neglect the temperature integral at the start of the linear heating,
ITo. An analytical equation is derived which describes the deviations introduced
by this assumption. It is shown that for most reactions encountered this
assumption does not have a significant influence on the accuracy of the method.
However in cases where To is within about 50 to of the reaction stage to be
investigated and activation energies are relatively low, significant deviations
are introduced. It is shown that some of the published thermal analysis work on
activation energy analysis of reactions occurring at relatively low temperatures
is affected by these deviations. Examples are specific cases of dehydration
reactions, cure reactions and cluster formation in Al alloys.

Atomic mechanisms of grain boundary diffusion: Low versus high temperatures. We
analyze recent results of atomistic computer simulations of grain boundary GB
diffusion in metals. At temperatures well below the bulk melting point T m GB
diffusion occurs by random walk of individual vacancies and self-interstitials.
Both defects are equal participants in the diffusion process and can move by a
large variety of diffusion mechanisms, many of which are collective transitions.
GB diffusion coefficients can be computed by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. At
high temperatures, the presence of large concentrations of point defects is
likely to alter the diffusion mechanisms. Molecular dynamics simulations of GB
structure and diffusion in copper reveal a continuous GB premelting in close
vicinity of T m . However, diffusion in high-energybecomes almost independent of
the GB structure universal at temperatures well below T m . This behavior can be
tentatively explained in terms of heterophase fluctuations from the solid to the
liquid phase. The exact diffusion mechanisms in the presence of heterophase
fluctuations are yet to be established.

material engineering and emerging applications of iron oxide nanoparticles. We
discuss material engineering of nanoparticles in the broadest sense, emphasizing
size and shape control, large-area self-assembly, composite/hybrid structures,
and surface engineering. This is followed by a discussion of several non-
traditional, emerging applications of iron oxide nanoparticles, including
nanoparticle lithography, magnetic particle imaging, magnetic guided drug
delivery, and positive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging. We
conclude with a succinct discussion of the pharmacokinetics pathways of iron
oxide nanoparticles in the human body -- an important and required practical
consideration for any in vivo biomedical application, followed by a brief
outlook of the field.

The influence of constrictivity on the effective transport properties of porous
layers in electrolysis and fuel cells. The aim of the present investigation is
to define microstructure parameters, which control the effective transport
properties in porous materials for energy technology. Recent improvements in
3D-imaging FIB-nanotomography, synchrotron X-ray tomography and image analysis
skeletonization and graph analysis, transport simulations open new possibilities
for the study of microstructure effects. In this study, we describe novel
procedures for a quantitative analysis of constrictivity, which characterizes
the so-called bottleneck effect. In a first experimental part, methodological
tests are performed using a porous La,SrCoO3 material SOFC cathode. The tests
indicate that the proposed procedure for quantitative analysis of constrictivity
gives reproducible results even for samples with inhomogeneous microstructures
cracks, gradient of porosity. In the second part, 3D analyses are combined with
measurements of ionic conductivity by impedance spectroscopy. The investigations
are preformed on membranes of electrolysis cells with porosities between 0.27
and 0.8. Surprisingly, the tortuosities remain nearly constant 1.6 for the
entire range of porosity. In contrast, the constrictivities vary strongly and
correlate well with the measured transport resistances. Hence, constrictivity
represents the dominant microstructure parameter, which controls the effective
transport properties in the analysed membrane materials. An empirical
relationship is then derived for the calculation of effective transport
properties based on phase volume fraction, tortuosity, and constrictivity.

A step forward from high-entropy ceramics to compositionally complex ceramics: a
new perspective. High-entropy ceramicshave quickly gained attention since 2015.
To date, nearly all work has focused on five-component, equimolar compositions.
This perspective article briefly reviews different families ofand selected
properties. Following a couple of our most recent studies, we propose a step
forward to expandto Compositionally Complex ceramicsto include medium-entropy
and non-equimolar compositions. Using defective fluorite and ordered pyrochlore
oxides as two primary examples, we further consider the complexities of
aliovalent cations and anion vacancies as well as ordered structures with two
cation sublattices. Better thermally-insulating yet stiffhave been found in non-
equimolar compositions with optimal amounts of oxygen vacancies and in ordered
pyrochlores with substantial size disorder. It is demonstrated that medium-
entropy ceramicscan prevail over their high-entropy counterparts. The
diversifying classes ofprovide even more possibilities thanto tailor the
composition, defects, disorder/order, and, consequently, various properties.

Intumescent flame retardant polyurethane/reduced graphene oxide composites with
improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. Intumescent flame
retardant polyurethane IFRPU composites were prepared in the presence of reduced
graphene oxide rGO as synergism, melamine, and microencapsulated ammonium
polyphosphate. The composites were examined in terms of thermal stability both
under nitrogen and air, electrical conductivity, gas barrier, flammability,
mechanical, and rheological properties. Wide-angle X-ray scattering and scanning
electron microscopy indicated that rGO are well-dispersed and exfoliated in the
IFRPU composites. The limiting oxygen index values increased from 22.0 to 34.0
with the addition of 18 wt% IFR along with 2 wt% rGO. Moreover, the
incorporation of rGO into IFRPU composites exhibited excellent antidripping
properties as well as UL-94 V0 rating. The thermal stability of the composites
enhanced. This was attributed to high surface area and good dispersion of rGO
sheets induced by strong interactions between PU and rGO. The oxygen
permeability, electrical, and viscoelasticity measurements, respectively,
demonstrated that rGO lead to much more reduction in the gas permeability by ~90
%, high electrical conductivity, and higher storage modulus of IFRPU composites.
The tensile strength, modulus, and shore A remarkably improved by the
incorporation of 2.0 wt% of rGO as well.

Analysis of the mechanical behavior of woven fibrous material using virtual
tests at the unit cell level. The determination of the mechanical properties of
fabrics in biaxial tension and in-plane shearing is made from 3D finite element
analyses of the unit woven cell. Compared to experimental tests these virtual
tests have several advantages. They can easily be carried out for sets of varied
parameters, they provide local information inside the woven material and above
all they can be performed on woven materials that have not yet been
manufactured. The 3D computations are not classical analyses because the yarns
are made up of several thousands of fibres and their mechanical behaviour is
very special. Several specific aspects of the analysis are detailed, especially
the use of a hypoelastic law based on an objective derivative using the rotation
of the fibre which allows a strict evolution of the directions of orthotropy
according to the fibre direction. Examples of analyses are presented in biaxial
tension and in-plane shear for woven reinforcements and in the case of the
biaxial tension of a knitted fabric. The results obtained are in good agreement
with experimental results.

Analyses of the mechanical properties and microstructure of bamboo-epoxy
composites. Bamboo reinforced epoxy possesses reasonably good properties to
waarrant its use as a structural material, and is fabricated by utilizing
bamboo, an abundant material resource, in the technology of fibre composites.
Literature on bamboo-plastics composites is rare. This work is an experimental
study of unidirectional bamboo-epoxy laminates of varying laminae number, in
which tensile, compressive, flexural and interlaminar shear properties are
evaluated. Further, the disposition of bamboo fibre, the parenchymatous tissue,
and the resin matrix under different loading conditions are examined. Our
results show that the specific strength and specific modulus of bamboo-epoxy
laminates are adequate, the former being 3 to 4 times that of mild steel. Its
mechanical properties are generally comparable to those of ordinary glass-fibre
composites. The fracture behaviour of bamboo-epoxy under different loading
conditions were observed using both acoustic emission techniques and scanning
electron microscopy. The fracture mode varied with load, the fracture mechanism
being similar to glass and carbon reinforced composites. Microstructural
analyses revealed that natural bamboo is eligibly a fibre composite in itself;
its inclusion in a plastic matrix will help solve the problems of cracking due
to desiccation and bioerosion caused by insect pests. Furthermore, the thickness
and shape of the composite can be tailored during fabrication to meet specific
requirements, thereby enabling a wide spectrum of applications.

Youngs modulus and volume porosity relationships for additive manufacturing
applications. Recent advancements in additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping
technologies allow the fabrication of end-use components with defined porous
structures. For example, one area of particular interest is the potential to
modify the flexibility bending stiffness of orthopedic implants through the use
of engineered porosity i.e., design and placement of pores and subsequent
fabrication of the implant using additive manufacturing processes. However,
applications of engineered porosity require the ability to accurately predict
mechanical properties from knowledge or characterization of the pore structure
and the existence of robust equations characterizing the propertyporosity
relationships.Youngs modulus can be altered by variations in pore shape as well
as pore distribution, numerous semi-analytical and theoretical relationships
have been proposed to describe the dependence of mechanical properties on
porosity. However, the utility and physical meaning of many of these
relationships is often unclear as most theoretical models are based on some
idealized physical microstructure, and the resulting correlations often cannot
be applied to real materials and practical applications. This review summarizes
the evolution and development of relationships for the effective Youngs modulus
of a porous material and concludes that verifiable equations yielding
consistently reproducible results tied to specific pore structures do not yet
exist. Further research is needed to develop and validate predictive equations
for the effective Youngs modulus over a volume porosity range of 2050 %, the
range of interest over which existing equations, whether based on effective
medium theories or empirical results, demonstrate the largest disparity and
offers the greatest opportunity for beneficial modification of bending stiffness
in orthopedic applications using currently available additive manufacturing
techniques.

structure of these ceramic materials, the characteristics of proton transport
mechanisms, and the potential applications for LT-PCCs will be summarized with
an emphasis on protonic conduction occurring at interfaces. Three temperature
zones are defined in the LT-PCC operating regime based on the predominant proton
transfer mechanism occurring in each zone. The variation in material properties,
such as crystal structure, conductivity, microstructure, fabrication methods
required to achieve the requisite grain size distribution, along with typical
strategies pursued to enhance the proton conduction, is addressed. Finally, a
perspective regarding applications of these materials to low-temperature solid
oxide fuel cells, hydrogen separation membranes, and emerging areas in the

Photochemistry on a polarisable semi-conductor: what do we understand today?.
The continued development of ferroelectric materials into more and more consumer
led applications has been at the forefront of recent ferroelectric material
research. It is, however, possible to view a ferroelectric as a wide band gap
semi-conductor that can sustain a surface charge density. This charge density
arises from the movement of ions in the crystal lattice and the need to
compensate for this charge. When viewing ferroelectrics as polarisable semi-
conductors a large number of new interactions are possible. One such is the use
of super band gap illumination to generate electronhole pairs. These
photogenerated carriers can then perform local electrochemistry. What is most
interesting for ferroelectric materials is that the REDOX chemistry can be
chosen by selectively modifying the domain structure of the ferroelectricwe can
perform oxidation and reduction on the surface of the same material at spatially
separate locations, or use the material to drive photoexcited carriers apart.
This means we can separate the REDOX products or produce patterns of
photogenerated material in places we have predetermined. This review aims to
introduce the background research that has led to the current understanding as
well a highlight some of the current areas that require further development.

Mechanical properties of CuCr system alloys with and without Zr and Ag. The
effects of addition of Zr and Ag on the mechanical properties of a Cu0.5 wt%Cr
alloy have been investigated. The addition of 0.15 wt%Zr enhances the strength
and resistance to stress relaxation of the CuCr alloy. The increase in strength
is caused by both the decrease in inter-precipitate spacing of Cr precipitates
and the precipitation of Cu5Zr phase. The stress relaxation resistance is
improved by the preferentially forming Cu5Zr precipitates on dislocations, in
addition to Cr precipitates on dislocations. The addition of 0.1 wt%Ag to the
CuCr and CuCrZr alloys improves the strength, stress relaxation resistance and
bend formability of these alloys. The increase in strength and stress relaxation
resistance is ascribed to the decrease in inter-precipitate spacing of Cr
precipitates and the suppression of recovery during aging, and to the Ag-atom-
drag effect on dislocation motion. The better bend formability of the Ag-added
alloys is explained in terms of the larger post-uniform elongation of the
alloys.

Toughening mechanisms in a multi-phase alloy of nylon 6,6/polyphenylene oxide.
Toughening mechanisms in a nylon 6,6/polyphenylene oxide PA/PPO alloy are
studied. This alloy consists of well dispersed PPO particles containing an
elastomeric phase in a PA matrix. Both crazing and shear yielding mechanisms are
found to be sequentially operative in this alloy. When a crack propagates in the
material, a crazed zone forms ahead of the crack tip. This crazed zone then
transforms into a shear yielded zone as the crack propagates through it. The
crazes inside the original crazed zone are closed or distorted by the shear
yielding process. In the transformed region, the shear yielded material is
oriented at different angles as the crack propagates. These findings are
consistent with the notion that hydrostatic tension has to be dissipated in
order for the remaining deviatoric stress to reach the critical value for
yielding. It is possible to partially attribute the increase in toughness to
both crack blunting and zone shielding mechanisms.

Intermittent bonding for high toughness/ high strength composites. High strength
and high are usually mutually exclusive in brittle filament/brittle matrix
composites. The high tensile strength characteristic of strong interfacial
filament/matrix bonding can, however, be combined with the high fracture of weak
interfacial bonding, when the filaments are arranged to have alternate sections
of high and low shear stress and low and high toughness. Such weak and strong
areas can be achieved by appropriate intermittent coating of the fibres. The
strong regions ensure that the filament strength is picked up; weak areas
randomly in the path of running cracks serve to blunt them by the Cook/Gordon
mechanism which, in turn, produces long pull-out lengths with an associated
large contribution to toughness. Boron-epoxy composites of volume fraction 0.20
to 0.25 have been made in this way which have fracture toughnesses of over 200
kd m -2, whilst retaining rule of mixtures tensile strengths ~ 650 MN m-2. At
the volume fractions used, this apparently represents Kic values greater than
100 MN m -3/2/, An analysis is presented for and strength which demonstrates, in
broad terms, the effects of varying the coating parameters of concern. Results
show that the toughness of interfaces is an important parameter, differences in
which may not be shown up in terms of interfacial strength. The choice of
coating material is crucial in getting the desired effect. Some observations are
made upon methods of measuring the components of in composites.

Reduction of nickel oxide particles by hydrogen studied in an environmental TEM.
In situ reduction of nickel oxide NiO particles is performed under 1.3mbar of
hydrogen gas H2 in an environmental transmission electron microscope ETEM.
Images, diffraction patterns and electron energy-loss spectra EELS are acquired
to monitor the structural and chemical evolution of the system during reduction,
whilst increasing the temperature. Ni nucleation on NiO is either observed to be
epitaxial or to involve the formation of randomly oriented grains. The growth of
Ni crystallites and the movement of interfaces result in the formation of pores
within the NiO grains to accommodate the volume shrinkage associated with the
reduction. Densification is then observed when the sample is nearly fully
reduced. The reaction kinetics is obtained using EELS by monitoring changes in
the shapes of the Ni L2,3 white lines. The activation energy for NiO reduction
is calculated from the EELS data using both a physical model-fitting technique
and a model-independent method. The results of the model-fitting procedure
suggest that the reaction is described by Avrami models whereby the growth and
impingement of Ni domains control the reaction, in agreement with the ETEM
observations.

Study of copper-alumina bonding. Bonding between copper and alumina can be

parameters on bond strength have been studied. Observations by transmisssion
electron microscopy have been performed to detect and analyse the nature and
evolution of interfacial compounds as a function of copper oxidation and bonding
time. Chemical reactions lead to the formation of the binary oxide CuAlO2. The
stability of this compound and the reversibility of chemical reactions appear to
be very dependent on the amount of oxygen present in the system.

Hydrous zirconium dioxide: interfacial properties, the formation of monodisperse

characteristics of hydrous zirconia gels obtained by hydrolysis of highly acidic
ZrOCl28H2O solutions at are described. Under adequate conditions, monodisperse
spherical hydrous zirconia is obtained. The role of sulphate and chloride ions
is described. The gel has a large water content, indicating only modest
crosslinking. Crystallization upon heating takes place with the formation of
both monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia polymorphs; X-ray line widening studies
do not indicate a particle size-crystal structure correlation. On the basis of
this observation and using Stranki's rule, the crystallization sequence upon
heating is rationalized. Surface properties of hydrous zirconia are discussed on
the basis of electrophoretic measurements, and compared with those of
baddeleyte. The site binding model is not very adequate to describe these
systems, and the existence of a very thin gel-like region at the baddeleyte-

Thermo-mechanical and fracture properties in single-crystal silicon. Single-

most of the steps during processing involve somehow thermo-mechanical treatment

major role: cleaving techniques used to obtain a thin silicon layer for
photovoltaic applications and MEMS. The evolution and validation of these new
processes often rely on numerical simulations. The accuracy of these
simulations, however, requires accurate input data for a wide temperature range.
Numerous studies have been performed, and most of the needed parameters are

silicon fracture properties depending on crystallographic orientations, and to

Fullerene-like models for microporous carbon. Microporous carbons are important
in a wide variety of applications, ranging from pollution control to
supercapacitors, yet their structure at the molecular level is poorly
understood. Over the years, many structural models have been put forward, but
none has been entirely satisfactory in explaining the properties of the carbons.
The discovery of fullerenes and fullerene-related structures such as carbon
nanotubes gave us a new perspective on the structure of solid carbon, and in
1997 it was suggested that microporous carbon may have a structure related to
that of the fullerenes. Recently, evidence in support of such a structure has
been obtained using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy,
electron energy loss spectroscopy and other techniques. This article describes
the development of ideas about the structure of microporous carbon, and reviews
the experimental evidence for a fullerene-related structure. Theoretical models
of the structural evolution of microporous carbon are summarised, and the use of
fullerene-like models to predict the adsorptive properties of microporous
carbons are reviewed.

A general perspective of FeMnAlC steels. During the last years, the scientific
and industrial community has focused on the astonishing properties of FeMnAlC
steels. These high advanced steels allow high-density reductions about ~15%
lighter than conventional steels, high corrosion resistance, high strength
ultimate tensile strength UTS ~1 Gpa and at the same time ductilities above 60%.
The increase of the tensile or yield strength and the ductility at the same time
is almost a special feature of this kind of new steels, which makes them so
interesting for many applications such as in the automotive, armor and mining
industry. The control of these properties depends on a complex relationship
between the chemical composition of the steel, the test temperature, the
external loads and the processing parameters of the steel. This review has been
conceived to tried to elucidate these complex relations and gather the most
important aspects of FeMnAlC steels developed so far.

The importance of constraint relief caused by rubber cavitation in the
toughening of epoxy. Many rubber-toughened epoxies are thought to derive the
bulk of their toughness through the processes of rubber cavitation and plastic
shear-yielding in the epoxy matrix. Constraint relief has been considered to be
a key mechanism which allows extra plastic shear deformation to occur. The
present work attempts to provide direct experimental evidence of the constraint
relief effect by combining testing geometries that vary the degree of constraint
with microscopic observations. The results show that the success of a rubber as
a toughening agent for epoxies is closely related to its ability to cavitate.
Evidence for local constraint relief is presented. Upon cavitation of the
rubber, the stress state in a specimen with initial constraint is found to
change to a plane stress state. The constraint relief circumvents or delays the
crack initiation in the matrix, which allows more plastic deformation to occur.

Chemical adsorption of NiO nanostructures on nickel foam-graphene for
supercapacitor applications. Few-layer graphene was synthesized on a nickel foam
template by chemical vapor deposition. The resulting three-dimensional 3D
graphene was loaded with nickel oxide nanostructures using the successive ionic
layer adsorption and reaction technique. The composites were characterized and
investigated as electrode material for supercapacitors. Raman spectroscopy
measurements on the sample revealed that the 3D graphene consisted of mostly few
layers, while X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy revealed the
presence of nickel oxide. The electrochemical properties were investigated using
cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and potentiostatic
chargedischarge in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The novelty of this study is the use
of the 3D porous cell structure of the nickel foam which allows for the growth
of highly conductive graphene and subsequently provides support for uniform
adsorption of the NiO onto the graphene. The NF-G/NiO electrode material showed
excellent properties as a pseudocapacitive device with a high-specific
capacitance value of 783Fg1 at a scan rate of 2mVs1. The device also exhibited
excellent cycle stability, with 84% retention of the initial capacitance after
1000 cycles. The results demonstrate that composites made using 3D graphene are
versatile and show considerable promise as electrode materials for
supercapacitor applications.

the material requirements of a new space propulsion device, the Variable

temperature-dependent properties of a range of dielectric ceramics, but data
presented could be used in the engineering design of any ceramic component with
complementary material requirements. A material is required for the gas

Improving interfacial properties of a laser beam welded dissimilar joint of

welds of aluminium alloy AA6056 and titanium alloy Ti6Al4V were produced by a
novel technique. AA6056 sheet was machined at one end to a U-slot shape,
enabling the intake of the Ti6Al4V sheet. The Al-alloy U-slot was then butt
welded by split laser beam without using a filling wire, thus making a weld by
melting only the Al-alloy. Thereby the intermetallic brittle phase TiAl3 formed

insignificant joint modification has refined microstructure and increased
hardness and strength. The most impressive feature was the improved resistance
to fatigue crack propagation whereby the fracture type in the fusion zone of
AA6056 adjacent to the weld interface changed from partially intercrystalline to

and grow in a whisker form. The oxygen partial pressure of the gas phase was
measured by an oxygen sensor and the gas phase was analysed for CO/CO2 by gas
chromatography. Silicon nitride was first formed as a granule, typically a
polycrystalline, and then grown as a single crystal whisker from the {1 00}
plane of the granule along the ~2 1 0 direction. The whiskers were identified
as/~'-sialon with Z value ranging from 0.8 to 1.1, determined by lattice
parameter measurements.

The quantitative calculation of SiC polytypes from measurements of X-ray
diffraction peak intensities. An experimental determination on powder mixtures
of SiC-3C and 6H polytypes using an X-ray goniometer system showed the
possibility of quantitative determination of polytype fraction directly from
peak intensities. In combination with calculated X-ray intensities of 15R and 4H
polytype, the method yields a simple equation system for the relative quantities
of SiC polytypes 15R, 6H, 4H and in polycrystalline samples and powder mixtures.

The mechanical behaviour of polyvinyl butyral at different strain magnitudes and
strain rates. The mechanical behaviour of polyvinyl butyral PVB at small 200% is
investigated experimentally over a range of strain rates to provide data for the
development and validation of constitutive models. The small-strain response is
investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies from 1 to 100 Hz
and temperatures from 80 to. It is found that a generalised Maxwell model
adequately describes the material behaviour in the small-strain regime. The
large-strain response is investigated using a high-speed servo hydraulic test
machine at strain rates from 0.2 to 400 s1. It is found that the PVB response is
characterised by a time-dependent steep initial rise in stress followed by a
hyperelastic type response until failure. No current material model completely
captures this time-dependent behaviour at large strains.

Secondary crystalline phases identification in Cu $$_2$$ 2 ZnSnSe $$_4$$ 4 thin
films: contributions from Raman scattering and photoluminescence. In this work,
we present the Raman peak positions of the quaternary pure selenide compound
Cu\_2\ZnSnSe\_4\ CZTSe and related secondary phases that were grown and studied
under the same conditions. A vast discussion about the position of the X-ray
diffraction XRD reflections of these compounds is presented. It is known that by
using XRD only, CZTSe can be identified but nothing can be said about the
presence of some secondary phases. Thin films of CZTSe, Cu\_2\SnSe\_3\, ZnSe,
SnSe, SnSe\_2\, MoSe\_2\ and a-Se were grown, which allowed their investigation
by Raman spectroscopy RS. Here we present all the Raman spectra of these phases
and discuss the similarities with the spectra of CZTSe. The effective analysis
depth for the common back-scattering geometry commonly used in RS measurements,
as well as the laser penetration depth for photoluminescence PL were estimated
for different wavelength values. The observed asymmetric PL band on a CZTSe film
is compatible with the presence of CZTSe single-phase and is discussed in the
scope of the fluctuating potentials' model. The estimated bandgap energy is
close to the values obtained from absorption measurements. In general, the phase
identification of CZTSe benefits from the contributions of RS and PL along with
the XRD discussion.

Piezoelectric anisotropy: Enhanced piezoelectric response along nonpolar
directions in perovskite crystals. This paper discusses the mechanisms that can
contribute to the enhanced longitudinal piezoelectric effect along nonpolar
directions in perovskite crystals, such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, KNbO3,
PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3PbTiO3 and PbZn1/2Nb2/3O3PbTiO3. Piezoelectric anisotropy is
discussed in relation to temperature induced phase transitions, compositional
variation in solid solutions with morphotropic phase boundaries, applied
electric fields, the domain wall structure and domain wall displacement.

Synthesis and sintering of Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, ZnO entropy-stabilized oxides
obtained by wet chemical methods. Entropy-stabilized oxides represent a novel
family of advanced ceramic materials with attractive functional properties. In
this work, entropy-stabilized oxides, in the system Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, ZnO, were
produced by co-precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis. Although TG/DTA and XRD
analyses of as-synthetized powders point out complex thermal evolution, in both
cases the desired single-phase rock salt solid solution was obtained after a
proper thermal treatment. The dilatometric analysis points out the excellent
sinterability of the obtained powders, which were successfully consolidated for
the first time reaching nearly full density ~97% at relatively low temperature
1050C.

The interlaminar toughness of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic composites using
hybrid-toughened matrices. The use of nano-SiO2 particles and rubbery particles
to give 'hybrid-toughened' epoxy polymers has been analyzed to give a range of
novel matrices which lead to an increased delamination toughness of the
resulting CFRP composites by resin-transfer molding RTM and vacuum-assisted
resin-transfer molding VARTM. The rubbery particles magnificently increase the
toughness of the material via interactions of the stress field ahead of the
crack tip compared with the pure epoxy polymer. Both particles are introduced to
give a multiphase 'hybrid-toughened' polymeric materials. The presence of a
relatively high concentration of the nano-SiO2 toughening particles does not
lead to a decrease in the modulus of the composite. These mechanisms will lead
to further increases in the mechanical performance of 'hybrid-toughened' epoxy
polymers, containing a complex multiphase structure of nano- and micro-sized
phase inclusions.

Sensitization evaluation of the austenitic stainless steel AISI 304L, 316L, 321
and 347. This work presents a systematic investigation of the influence of time
and temperature in the sensitization of stainless steel AISI 304L, AISI 316L,
AISI 321 and AISI 347 pipes used in petroleum refining plants. The sensitization
was assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM according to ASTM A-262 and by
the Double Loop Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation test DLEPR. The
results showed that all steels did not present sensitization at operating
temperature 380C in the desulfurizers process, but the temperature of was
critical to the appearing of sensitization for the both low carbon stainless
steels and AISI 321 SS, while for the AISI 347 the critical temperature was. The
stabilized steels confirmed to be more resistant to sensitization than the low
carbon stainless steels, and niobium showed to be more efficient stabilizing
agent than titanium.

Thermal and mechanical behaviour of flexible polyurethane foams modified with
graphite and phosphorous fillers. Flexible polyurethane foams FPF are polymer
materials that have high flammability. Fyrol PNX FPNX and expandable graphite
EG, have been used to modify the properties of these materials. The aim of this
study was to assess the possibility of improving the thermal stability and flame
retardancy of FPF by the addition of FPNX and EG fillers. The prepared foams
were characterised by their apparent density, hardness, flexibility,
irreversible strain and linear flammability, as well as thermogravimetric
analysis TGA, dynamic mechanical analysis, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy FT-IR and pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry PCFC measurements.
The apparent density, hardness, flexibility and irreversible strain results
showed that the addition of graphite and phosphorous fillers to the FPF makes
slight changes to the mechanical properties, which remain within the acceptable
norms. It was also observed that reducing the amount of Fyrol PNX and replacing
it with the same amount of EG allowed similar values of linear flammability to
be obtained with a simultaneous increase in thermal stability, as shown in the
TGA study and the PCFC test. Moreover, it was found that the modification of
flexible polyurethane foam by the addition of a mixture of FPNX and EG fillers
allows the best properties of this type of materials to be obtained. This result
indicates that this type of modification could be an effective way to improve
the thermal stability of FPF.

Morphing in nature and beyond: a review of natural and synthetic shape-changing
materials and mechanisms. Shape-changing materials open an entirely new solution
space for a wide range of disciplines: from architecture that responds to the
environment and medical devices that unpack inside the body, to passive sensors
and novel robotic actuators. While synthetic shape-changing materials are still
in their infancy, studies of biological morphing materials have revealed key
paradigms and features which underlie efficient natural shape-change. Here, we
review some of these insights and how they have been, or may be, translated to
artificial solutions. We focus on soft matter due to its prevalence in nature,
compatibility with users and potential for novel design. Initially, we review
examples of natural shape-changing materialsskeletal muscle, tendons and plant
tissuesand compare with synthetic examples with similar methods of operation.
Stimuli to motion are outlined in general principle, with examples of their use
and potential in manufactured systems. Anisotropy is identified as a crucial
element in directing shape-change to fulfil designed tasks, and some
manufacturing routes to its achievement are highlighted. We conclude with
potential directions for future work, including the simultaneous development of
materials and manufacturing techniques and the hierarchical combination of
effects at multiple length scales.

Interfacial fracture energy and the toughness of composites. The premises upon
which prevailing composite toughness theories are based are discussed in the
light of observed strength variations in boron-epoxy composites with differing
shear strengths of the interfacial bond. None of the extant toughness theories
pull-out, debonding, stress redistribution successfully predicts the work of
fracture of the boronepoxy system. However, incorporation of the work to create
new surfaces into the total toughness analysis gives better agreement with
experiment, and work of fracture predictions for other sytems, such as carbon-
polyester, can also be modified. The approach is more generalized than the
Outwater/Murphy debonding explanation for toughness, which in the way usually
presented only applies when the filament fracture strain is greater than the
matrix fracture strain. The present analysis suggests how to tailor the
interfacial shear strength in order to obtain a reasonable toughness yet still
maintain strengths of the order of the rule of mixtures.

A combined synchrotron powder diffraction and vibrational study of the thermal
treatment of palygorskiteindigo to produce Maya blue. The heating process 30200
C of a palygorskite-indigo mixture has been monitored in situ and simultaneously
by synchrotron powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. During this process,
the dye and the clay interact to form Maya blue MB, a pigment highly resistant
to degradation. It is shown that the formation of a very stable pigment occurs
in the interval;e., when palygorskite starts to loose zeolitic water, and is
accompanied by a reduction of the crystallographic a parameter, as well as by
alterations in the C=C and C=O bonds of indigo. Mid- and near-infrared
spectroscopic work and microporosity measurements, employed to study the
rehydration process after the complex formation, provide evidence for the
inhibition of the rehydration of MB as compared with palygorskite. These results
are consistent with the blocking of the palygorskite tunnel entrance by indigo
molecules with a possible partial penetration inside the tunnels. The surface
silanols of palygorskite are not perturbed by indigo, suggesting that MB is not
a surface complex.

Actual versus apparent within cell wall variability of nanoindentation results
from wood cell walls related to cellulose microfibril angle. Hardness and
elastic modulus of spruce wood cell walls parallel to their axial direction were
investigated by means of nanoindentation. In the secondary cell wall layer S2 of
individual earlywood and compression wood tracheids, a systematic pattern
variability was found. Several factors potentially affecting nanoindentation
results were investigated,e. specimen orientation related to the indenter tip,
cutting direction during specimen preparation, tip geometry, specimen and fibre
inclination, respectively, and finally micro fibril orientation. Mechanical
property measurements were correlated with structural features measured by
confocal Raman spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that very high variability in
the measurement of micromechanical cell wall properties can be caused by
unintentional small fibre misalignment by few degrees with regard to the
indentation direction caused by sub-optimal specimen preparation.

High performance Bi2Te3 nanocomposites prepared by single-element-melt-spinning
spark-plasma sintering. The last decade has witnessed nanocomposites becoming a
new paradigm in the field of thermoelectric TE research. At its core is to
prepare high performance TE nanocomposites, both p- and n-type, in a time and
energy efficient way. To this end, we in this article summarize our recent
effort and results on both p- and n-type Bi2Te3-based nanocomposites prepared by
a unique single-element-melt-spinning spark-plasma sintering procedure. The
results of transport measurements, scanning and transmission electronic
microscopy, and small angle neutron scattering have proved essential in order to
establish the correlation between the nanostructures and the TE performance of
the materials. Interestingly, we find that in situ formed nanocrystals with
coherent boundaries are the key nanostructures responsible for the significantly
improved TE performance of p-type Bi2Te3 nanocomposites whereas similar
nanostructures turn out to be less effective for n-type Bi2Te3 nanocomposites.
We also discuss the alternative strategies to further improve the TE performance
of n-type Bi2Te3 materials via nanostructuring processes.
