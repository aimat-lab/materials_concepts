Review of the anatase to rutile phase transformation. Titanium dioxide, TiO2, is
an important photocatalytic material that exists as two main polymorphs, anatase
and rutile. The presence of either or both of these phases impacts on the
photocatalytic performance of the material. The present work reviews the anatase
to rutile phase transformation. The synthesis and properties of anatase and
rutile are examined, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamics of the phase
transformation and the factors affecting its observation. A comprehensive
analysis of the reported effects of dopants on the anatase to rutile phase
transformation and the mechanisms by which these effects are brought about is
presented in this review, yielding a plot of the cationic radius versus the
valence characterised by a distinct boundary between inhibitors and promoters of
the phase transformation. Further, the likely effects of dopant elements,
including those for which experimental data are unavailable, on the phase
transformation are deduced and presented on the basis of this analysis.

Review: liquid phase sintering. Liquid phase sintering LPS is a process for
forming high performance, multiple-phase components from powders. It involves
sintering under conditions where solid grains coexist with a wetting liquid.
Many variants of LPS are applied to a wide range of engineering materials.
Example applications for this technology are found in automobile engine
connecting rods and high-speed metal cutting inserts. Scientific advances in
understanding LPS began in the 1950s. The resulting quantitative process models
are now embedded in computer simulations to enable predictions of the sintered
component dimensions, microstructure, and properties. However, there are
remaining areas in need of research attention. This LPS review, based on over
2,500 publications, outlines what happens when mixed powders are heated to the
LPS temperature, with a focus on the densification and microstructure evolution
events.

Review: environmental friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials. Lead zirconate
titanate PZT based piezoelectric materials are well known for their excellent
piezoelectric properties. However, considering the toxicity of lead and its
compounds, there is a general awareness for the development of environmental
friendly lead-free materials as evidenced from the legislation passed by the
European Union in this effect. Several classes of materials are now being
considered as potentially attractive alternatives tofor specific applications.
In this paper, attempts have been made to review the recent developments on
lead-free piezo materials emphasizing on their preparation, structureproperty
correlation, etc. In this context, perovskite systems such as bismuth sodium
titanate, alkali niobates ANbO3, etc. and non-perovskites such as bismuth layer-
structured ferroelectrics are reviewed in detail. From the above study, it is
concluded that some lead-free compositions show stable piezoelectric responses
even though they do not match the overall performance of PZT. This has been the
stimulant for growing research on this subject. This topic is of current
interest to the researchers worldwide as evidenced from the large number of
research publications. This has motivated us to come out with a review article
with a view that it would give further impetus to the researchers already
working in this area and also draw the attention of the others.

Toughening mechanisms in elastomer-modified epoxies. Some brittle epoxies can be
toughened significantly by the addition of an elastomeric phase. A great deal of
controversy still exists on the nature of the toughening mechanisms. In this
work tensile dilatometry at constant displacement rates was used to determine
whether voiding, crazing or shear banding are the deformation mechanisms.
Diglycidyl ether-bisphenol A epoxies toughened by various levels of several
types of carboxyl-terminated butadiene nitrile liquid rubber were studied. The
results indicate that at low strain rates the rubber particles simply enhance
shear deformation. At sufficiently high strain rates the rubber particles
cavitate and subsequently promote further shear deformation. No indication of
crazing as an important toughening mechanism is found. No significant effect of
rubber particle size or type can be ascertained.

Microcapsule induced toughening in a self-healing polymer composite.
Microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene DCPD healing agent and Grubbs' Ru catalyst
are incorporated into an epoxy matrix to produce a polymer composite capable of
self-healing. The fracture toughness and healing efficiency of this composite
are measured using a tapered double-cantilever beam TDCB specimen. Both the
virgin and healed fracture toughness depend strongly on the size and
concentration of microcapsules added to the epoxy. Fracture of the neat epoxy is
brittle, exhibiting a mirror fracture surface. Addition of DCPD-filled urea-
formaldehyde UF microcapsules yields up to 127% increase in fracture toughness
and induces a change in the fracture plane morphology to hackle markings. The
fracture toughness of epoxy with embedded microcapsules is much greater than
epoxy samples with similar concentrations of silica microspheres or solid UF
polymer particles. The increased toughening associated with fluid-filled
microcapsules is attributed to increased hackle markings as well as subsurface
microcracking not observed for solid particle fillers. Overall the embedded
microcapsules provide two independent effects: the increase in virgin fracture
toughness from general toughening and the ability to self-heal the virgin
fracture event.

Ultra-high-strength polyethylene filaments by solution spinning/drawing. This
paper deals with ultra-high-strength monofilaments of linear polyethylene that
are produced by solution spinning and subsequent hot drawing at. The influence
of the draw ratio on the mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres was
investigated. Some salient features of a polyethylene filament with a draw ratio
of 31.7 are: tensile strength at break=3.0 GPa, Young's modulus=90 GPa and DSC-
melting point at a scan speed of min1=145.5 C. The modulus was found to depend
linearly on the draw ratio. The tensile strength tended, by contrast, to
approach an upper limit at high draw ratios. Additional morphological and X-ray
studies revealed an extremely good orientation of the macromolecules in the
fibre direction of the highly drawn polyethylene monofilaments.

Toughening mechanisms in elastomer-modified epoxies. The role Of matrix
ductility on the toughenability and toughening mechanism of elastomer-modified,
diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A DGEBA-based epoxies is investigated. Matrix
ductility is varied by using epoxide resins of varying epoxide monomer molecular
weights. These epoxide resins are cured using 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulphone DDS
and, in some cases, modified with 10 vol% carboxyl-terminated copolymer of
butadiene and acrylonitrile CTBN. Fracture toughness values for the neat epoxies
are found to be almost independent of the monomer molecular weight of the
epoxide resin used. However, the fracture toughness of the elastomer-modified
epoxies is found to be very dependent upon the epoxide monomer molecular weight.
Tensile dilatometry indicates that the toughening mechanism, when present, is
similar to the mechanism found for piperidine cured, elastomer-modified epoxies
studied previously. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy
techniques corroborate this finding.

Influence of particle size and particle size distribution on toughening
mechanisms in rubber-modified epoxies. The principal toughening mechanism of a
substantially toughened, rubber-modified epoxy has again been shown to involve
internal cavitation of the rubber particles and the subsequent formation of
shear bands. Additional evidence supporting this sequence of events which
provides a significant amount of toughness enhancement, is presented. However,
in addition to this well-known mechanism, more subtle toughening mechanisms have
been found in this work. Evidence for such mechanisms as crack deflection and
particle bridging is shown under certain circumstances in rubber-modified
epoxies. The occurrence of these toughening mechanisms appears to have a
particle size dependence. Relatively large particles provide only a modest
increase in fracture toughness by a particle bridging/crack deflection
mechanism. In contrast, smaller particles provide a significant increase in
toughness by cavitation-induced shear banding. A critical, minimum diameter for
particles which act as bridging particles exists and this critical diameter
appears to scale with the properties of the neat epoxy. Bimodal mixtures of
epoxies containing small and large particles are also examined and no
synergistic effects are observed.

compared with the actual macroscopic behaviour of polymers, is herein compared
with the pressure-modified octahedral shear stress criterion earlier suggested

Glass-ceramics: Their production from wastesA Review. Glass-ceramics are
polycrystalline materials of fine microstructure that are produced by the
controlled crystallisation devitrification of a glass. Numerous silicate based
filter dusts from waste incinerators, mud from metal hydrometallurgy, different
types of sludge as well as glass cullet or mixtures of them have been considered
for the production of glass-ceramics. Developments of glass-ceramics from waste
using different processing methods are described comprehensively in this review,
covering R&D work carried out worldwide in the last 40 years. Properties and
applications of the different glass-ceramics produced are discussed. The review
reveals that considerable knowledge and expertise has been accumulated on the
process of transformation of silicate waste into useful glass-ceramic products.
These glass-ceramics are attractive as building materials for usage as
construction and architectural components or for other specialised technical
applications requiring a combination of suitable thermo-mechanical properties.
Previous attempts to commercialise glass-ceramics from waste and to scale-up
production for industrial exploitation are also discussed.

Ceramic matrix composites containing carbon nanotubes. Due to the remarkable
physical and mechanical properties of individual, perfect carbon nanotubes they
are considered to be one of the most promising new reinforcements for structural
composites. Their impressive electrical and thermal properties also suggest
opportunities for multifunctional applications. In the context of inorganic
matrix composites, researchers have particularly focussed onas toughening
elements to overcome the intrinsic brittleness of the ceramic or glass material.
Although there are now a number of studies published in the literature, these
inorganic systems have received much less attention than CNT/polymer matrix
composites. This paper reviews the current status of the research and
development of CNT-loaded ceramic matrix composite CMC materials. It includes a
summary of the key issues related to the optimisation of CNT-based composites,
with particular reference to brittle matrices and provides an overview of the
processing techniques developed to optimise dispersion quality, interfaces, and
density. The properties of the various composite systems are discussed, with an
emphasis on toughness; a comprehensive comparative summary is provided, together
with a discussion of the possible toughening mechanism that may operate. Last, a
range of potential applications are discussed, concluding with a discussion of
the scope for future developments in the field.

Overview of transient liquid phase and partial transient liquid phase bonding.
Transient liquid phase TLP bonding is a relatively new bonding process that
joins materials using an interlayer. On heating, the interlayer melts and the
interlayer element or a constituent of an alloy interlayer diffuses into the
substrate materials, causing isothermal solidification. The result of this
process is a bond that has a higher melting point than the bonding temperature.
This bonding process has found many applications, most notably the joining and
repair of Ni-based superalloy components. This article reviews important aspects
of TLP bonding, such as kinetics of the process, experimental details bonding
time, interlayer thickness and format, and optimal bonding temperature, and
advantages and disadvantages of the process. A wide range of materials that TLP
bonding has been applied to is also presented. Partial transient liquid phase
PTLP bonding is a variant of TLP bonding that is typically used to join
ceramics. PTLP bonding requires an interlayer composed of multiple layers; the
most common bond setup consists of a thick refractory core sandwiched by thin,
lower-melting layers on each side. This article explains how the experimental
details and bonding kinetics of PTLP bonding differ from TLP bonding. Also, a
range of materials that have been joined by PTLP bonding is presented.

The toughness of epoxy polymers and fibre composites modified with rubber
microparticles and silica nanoparticles. The present paper investigates the
effect of adding silica nanoparticles to an anhydride-cured epoxy polymer in
bulk and when used as the matrix of carbon- and glass-fibre reinforced
composites. The formation of hybrid epoxy polymers, containing both silica
nanoparticles and carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile CTBN rubber
microparticles, is also discussed. The structure/property relationships are
considered, with an emphasis on the toughness and the toughening mechanisms. The
fracture energy of the bulk epoxy polymer was increased from 77 to 212J/m2 by
the presence of 20wt% of silica nanoparticles. The observed toughening
mechanisms that were operative were a plastic shear-yield bands, and b debonding
of the matrix from the silica nanoparticles, followed by plastic void-growth of
the epoxy. The largest increases in toughness observed were for the hybrid
materials. Here a maximum fracture energy of 965J/m2 was measured for a hybrid
epoxy polymer containing 9wt% and 15wt% of the rubber microparticles and silica
nanoparticles, respectively. Most noteworthy was the observation that these
increases in the toughness of the bulk polymers were found to be transferred to
the fibre composites. Indeed, the interlaminar fracture energies for the fibre-
composite materials were increased even further by a fibre-bridging toughening
mechanism. The present work also extends an existing model to predict the
toughening effect of the nanoparticles in a thermoset polymer. There was
excellent agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the
epoxy containing the silica nanoparticles, and for epoxy polymers containing
micrometre-sized glass particles. The latter, relatively large, glass particles
were investigated to establish whether a nano-effect, with respect to increasing
the toughness of the epoxy bulk polymers, did indeed exist.

energy types.a result, the storage of these different types of energy becomes a
key issue. Supercapacitors, as one important energy storage device, have gained
much attention and owned a wide range of applications by taking advantages of
micro-size, lightweight, high power density and long cycle life. From this
perspective, numerous studies, especially on electrode materials, have been
reported and great progress in the advancement in both the fundamental and
applied fields of supercapacitor has been achieved. Herein, a review of recent
progress in carbon materials for supercapacitor electrodes is presented. First,

The preparation and characterization of alumina membranes with ultra-fine pores.
Alumina films less than 20m thick are prepared by a process in which a boehmite
sol is successively gelled, dried and calcined. The resulting structure has the
unique property that only ultra-fine pores with a narrow pore size distribution
are present within large crack-free layers. The microstructure can be influenced
by the sintering temperature and the acid concentration of the precursor sol.
The minimum modal pore size which has been obtained is 2.5 nm. A consistent

Investigation on magnetorheological elastomers based on natural rubber.
Magnetorheological Elastomers MR Elastomers orare a kind of novel smart
material, whose mechanical, electrical, magnetic properties are controllable
under applied magnetic fields. They have attracted increasing attentions and
broad application prospects. But conventionalare limited to wide applications
because their MR effects and mechanical performances are not high enough. This
paper aims to optimize the fabrication method and to fabricate good natural
rubber basedwith high modulus by investigating the influences of a variety of
fabrication conditions on theperformances, such as matrix type, external
magnetic flux density, and temperature, plasticizer and iron particles. Among
these factors, the content of iron particles plays a most important contribution
in shear modulus. When the iron particle weight fraction is 80% and the external
magnetic flux density is 1 T, the field-induced increment of shear modulus
reaches 3.6 MPa, and the relative MR effect is 133%. If the iron weight fraction
increases to 90%, the field-induced increment of shear modulus is 4.5 MPa. This
result has exceeded the best report in the literatures researching theon the
same kind of matrix. The dynamic performances ofwere also experimentally
characterized by using a modified Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer DMA system. The
effects of strain amplitude and driving frequency on viscoelastic properties

structures. When a plate vibrates, the breathing crack will produce the open and
closing movement, and the structure has nonlinear dynamic response
characteristics. In this paper, the contact nonlinearity of a plate structure
with a breathing crack is considered, and the nonlinear vibration of the
breathing cracked plate is analyzed. The structural intensity is studied under
dynamic excitation and the surface structural intensity vector field of the
structure is determined. The position and shape of the crack are identified by
the structural intensity maps, which provide a theoretical basis for the damage

New Eco-Friendly Gypsum Materials for Civil Construction. The sustainable worlds
economic growth and peoples life improvement greatly depend on the use of
alternative products in the architecture and construction, such as industrial
wastes conventionally called green materials. This paper concerns the main
results of an experimental work carried out with the objective of developing new
composite materials based on gypsum and incorporating waste material as
granulated cork, a by-product of cork industry, and cellulose fibres, a waste of
paper industry. Such materials are intended to be used as composite boards for
non structural elements of construction, such as dry walls and ceiling. Cork
bark of the plant Quercus Suber L, a substance largely produced in Portugal, is
a material whose characteristics are of considerable interest for the
construction industry. It is regarded as a strategic material with enormous
potential by its reduced density, elasticity, compressibility, waterproof,
vibration absorption, thermal and acoustic insulation efficiency 1. During the
first stage of this research work the gypsum binder and its properties were
studied. Then, composites with mineral additions added to increase the
waterproofing and resistance were also developed and submitted to tests to
determine their physical and mechanical properties. In last stage, reinforced
composites using different industrial by-products have been developed. This
paper will present the properties and the manufacture methods used to produce
the above mentioned eco-friendly composites that can ease ways for using
industrial wastes as new construction materials, with excellent inherent thermal
and acoustic properties.

Strain and stress tensors of rolled uranium plate by Rietveld refinement of TOF
neutron-diffraction data. We report the complete macroscopic average strain and
stress tensors for a cold-rolled uranium plate, based on the neutron TOF
measurements. Both tensors were determined by the least-squares refinement of
the interplanar spacings of 19 Bragg reflections. Based on the pole figures, as
determined by GSAS, a triclinic sample symmetry of the uranium plate was
assumed. Strain and stress are tensile in both the transverse and rolling
directions and very small in the normal direction through the thickness of the
plate. Shear strain and stress components are compressive and of significant
magnitude.

TiO2Based Sorbent of Lead Ions. The non-magnetic TiO2 powder and magnetically
modified TiO2 powder were employed for the sorption experiments. FeSO4 .7H2O was
used for synthesis of magnetically responsive TiO2 . The non-magnetic and
prepared magnetic materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
and X-ray diffraction methods. The particle size and specific surface area were
determined. A detailed study of the adsorption process performed using batch
adsorption experiments was carried out with various concentrations of lead ions
and contact time. A flame atomic absorption spectrometer was used for
determination of Pb2+ ions concentration in solution. Adsorption process has
been modeled by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms using linear and non-
linear regression. The results showed that the adsorption of Pb2+ ions on the
magnetic and non-magnetic TiO2 particles occurred in a monolayer. Presence of
magnetic iron oxides particles on the surface of sorbents increased the
adsorption rate, and increased the maximum amount of adsorbed Pb2+ ions per mass
in comparison with adsorption on the non-magnetic TiO2 particles. The
magnetically modified TiO2 particles allow magnetic separation of the sorbents
with already adsorbed ions of pollutants.

Development of a high temperature flow stress model for AerMet 100 covering
several orders of magnitude of strain rate. Constant strain rate, constant
velocity and Hopkinson Pressure Bar compression tests were carried out on AerMet
The results were used to generate a predictive flow stress model over the entire
range of test conditions. The effect of initial austenite grain size on flow
stress was found to follow the HallPetch relationship. This dependency was then
removed through innovative heat treatments. The morphology of the flow stress
curves were also dependent on mechanisms of microstructural evolution which were
controlled by the test method, strain rate and temperature. Friction and
adiabatic heating also had a major contribution. A novel method was proposed in
order to define the flow stress, which was then used to determine the work
hardening exponent of the ZenerHollomon equation. It was found that a deviation
from the linear trend was observed in Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests and reasons
were given. An artificial neural network approach was used to determine a more
accurate predictive flow stress model which included the effects of test method,
temperature, stain rate and initial austenite grain size. The method showed that
it was possible to predict the flow stress between 50 and 2000s1 where
mechanical testings results were absent.

Study on microstructure and properties of forged medium-chrome alloy white cast
iron. Adopting forging method and proper heat treatment after forging can
improve significantly the impact toughness of chromium alloy white cast
iron.Making use of hot plasticity upsetting test method,the hot plasticity of
medium-chrome alloy white cast iron with different carbon content,and the
influence of carbon on the hot plasticity of medium-chrome one were studied.The
effect of different heat treatment processes on its forged microstructure and
properties was also studied.The results show that medium-chrome alloy white cast
iron with 1.85%2.59% carbon content has,in 8501130 ranges,good forgeability,and
its hot plasticity becomes bad up to the increase of carbon content.The main
reason is that the difference of carbon content causes the change of the
quantity of eutectic carbide in organization.On the basis of them,the heat-
treating technology which can improve significantly the impact abrasive
resistance of forging medium-chrome alloy white cast iron were put forward.

Integration of moth-eye structures into a polydimethylsiloxane stamp for the
replication of functionalized microlenses using UV-nanoimprint lithography. The
increasing demand for low cost camera modules for mobile devices requires
technological solutions for the manufacturing process. One of the most promising
fabrication processes for microlenses for camera modules is UV-nanoimprint
lithography. In a typical fabrication process, an elastomer stamp is used to
replicate microlenses. In this work, a method is presented to integrate moth-eye
structures as an antireflective layer into a polydimethylsiloxane PDMS stamp
containing a microlens array. The integration of these structures is done by a
thermoforming process. Due to the integration of the moth-eye structures into
the PDMS stamp, the optical performance of the replicated microlenses can be
improved and no additional processing steps are necessary after the replication
process.

Laboratory Investigation on Compressive Strength and Micro-structural Features
of Foamed Concrete with Addition of Wood Ash and Silica Fume as a Cement
Replacement. Wood Ash WA and Silica Fume SF exhibit good cementation properties
and have great potential as supplementary binder materials for the concrete
production industry. This study will focus on enhancing the micro-structural
formation and compressive strength of foamed concrete with the addition of WA
and SF. A total of 3 mixes were prepared with the addition of WA and SF at
various cement replacement levels by total binder weight. For this particular
study, the combination of WA 5%, 10%, and 15% by binder weight and SF5 %, 10%,
and 15% by binder weight were utilized as supplementary binder materials to
produce foamed concrete mixes.was made evident from micrographs obtained in the
study, the improvement observed in the compressive strength of the foamed
concrete was due to a significant densification in the microstructure of the
cement paste matrix in the presence of WA and SF hybrid supplementary binders.
Experimental results indicated that the combination of 15% SF and 5% WA by
binder weight had a more substantial influence on the compressive strength of
foamed concrete compared to the control mix. Furthermore, the addition of WA and
SF significantly prolonged the setting times of the blended cement paste of the
foamed concrete.

Strength and Bioactivity of Hydroxyapatite/White Portland Cement HAp/WPC under
Simulated Body Fluid SBFSolution. In this study, the effects of curing white
Portland cement WPC and hydroxyapatite mixed with white Portland cement HAp/WPC
pastes in water and the in vitro biological environment on the compressive
strength and bone-like apatite formation were examined. The compressive strength
of both WPC and HAp/WPC pastes increased with longer curing periods in water.
The compressive strength of WPC and HAp/WPC pastes was 51.88 and 25.67 MPa,
respectively, after curing in water for 28 days. The compressive strength of
both samples continuously increased during in vitro testing in a simulated body
fluid SBF. After 4 weeks of immersion in a SBF, the strengths of cured WPC and
HAp/WPC samples were 59.01 and 28.06 MPa, respectively. It is due to continued
hydration of WPC. The addition of HAp to WPC decreased the compressive strength
of the sample. Alternatively, it enhanced bone-like apatite formation on the
surface of the samples.

crack propagation path, has revealed inter-granular nature of creep crack
propagation. This is attributed to the grain boundary -phase precipitations,
which were found to be coarser as compared to the -phase precipitations in the
grain interiors, leading to easier damage accumulation and microcrack formation
in their vicinity.

Free Vibration Modeling and Computation of Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe RTP
Conveying Fluid in Off/Inshore Industry Applications. Reinforced Thermoplastic
Pipe RTP is a composite material flexible pipe. Due to RTP superior behavior, it
encouraged the industry for using to offshore and inshore applications. Marine
risers and cross-country pipelines resting on elastic medium are slender
flexible structures conveying fluid and exhibit complex dynamic behaviors.
Therefore, it requires accurate dynamic modeling for prediction the vibration
characteristics. Transfer Matrix Method for Multibody Systems MSTMM is one of
the sophisticated methods that can be used efficiently to model large systems
and calculate its vibration characteristics and dynamic responses. The size of
matrices in MSTMM remains small regardless of the number of elements in the
model. Having smaller matrix sizes helps to have less computational expense
leading to a faster answer. Based on the MSTMM advantages and Euler-Bernoulli
linear theory, transfer matrix of the pipe in both offshore and inshore industry
applications is built-up for vibration analysis. Recursive eigenvalue search
algorithm is used to determine the system frequencies. Numerical examples are
performed to validate with those published in the open literature.

during friction stir processing. In this study, the effect of friction stir
processing FSP by various transverse welding speeds of 50150mm/min on mechanical
results showed that defectless FSPed specimen was obtained at the transverse
speed of 100mm/min. Microstructural analysis was carried out by scanning
electron microscope equipped with electron backscattered diffraction EBSD
detector. It was found that by increasing the transverse speed, more significant
grain refinement was observed in the stir zone. Furthermore, deformation induced
martensite was not observed in the area subjected to FSP. Significant grain
refinement resulted from dynamic recrystallization was found to be responsible
for hindering formation of deformation induced martensite in the weldment
section after tensile deformation test. Tensile test results showed that yield
strength YS was increased from 145MPa to 210MPa in the FSPed specimens. However,
tensile elongation was restricted in the FSP processed specimens which may be
due to limitation of TRIP phenomenon.

Electronic properties of black phosphorus using monochromated low-loss EELS. In
the present study, monochromated low-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a
scanning transmission electron microscope, confronted with ab-initio
calculations, is used to investigate the bandgap and excitons energies of black
phosphorus flakes in the near infrared region. Due to the monochromation of the
electron beam and to a spectrometer with an energy resolution of 20meV, a direct
measurement of the narrow bandgap energy, E0, of about 0.33eV was successful,
along with an intraband electronic transition E1 at around 0.75eV.
Interestingly, additional transitions, excitonic in nature, are identified at
0.42eV and 0.55eV, the intensity of which increases with decreasing thickness.
All these findings demonstrate the ability of monochromated low-loss electron
energy loss spectroscopy to reveal unprecedented electronic and excitonic
transitions in very narrow bandgap semiconductors.

High-efficiency, self-grinding exfoliation of small graphene nanosheets from
microcrystalline graphite driven by microbead milling as conductive additives.
Direct mass exfoliation of graphene from bulk graphite with high yield and
productivity for commercial applications is challenging. This work proposes
self-grinding exfoliation using the mutual shear friction of graphite particles
to fabricate graphene from microcrystalline graphite. The concept is implemented
using microbeads as the grinding medium to drive the shear friction between
graphite nanocrystals in a high-concentration paste. The proposed approach
substantially improves graphene yield from 6.3% to 100% and simultaneously
generates a record productivity of 7.5 g h1 L1, achieving total graphite-to-
graphene conversion on the kilogram scale. The as-prepared graphene nanosheets
have an average lateral size of 298 nm and the same C/O atomic ratio as the
pristine graphite. In addition, the well-exfoliated, small nanosheets display
good electrical conductivity and exhibit significant potential as conductive
additives that improve the specific capacity and cyclic stability of Li-ion
batteries better than commercial carbon-based conductive particles.

Radiotracer Diffusion of Ni and Ag in Ag and Ni Grain Boundaries and Oriented
Ag/NiInterphase Boundaries. Grain boundary and interphase boundary diffusion has
been investigated in the system Ag/Ni using the radiotracer serial sectioning
technique. Ni segregation in Ag grain boundaries is strongly temperature
dependent leading to the conclusion that Ni atoms are located mainly in the bulk
planes adjacent to the grain boundary. From interphase boundary diffusion
measurements in 110 oriented Ag/Ni interphase boundaries it can be deduced that
the structure of this interphase boundary is incoherent.

consists of fiber bundles and matrix. The unit cell model was developed based on
the observation of cross sections of The elastic modulus ofwas calculated from
the results of finite element analysis using the developed model. The non-linear

Nonlinear elastic response and anharmonic properties of MgO single crystal:
First-principles investigation. Knowledge of the nonlinear elastic response and
anharmonic properties of MgO single crystal is important for interpreting the
seismically observed velocity variations in the Earths mantle and constructing
reliable mineralogical modes of the Earths interior. However, investigations on
these properties of it have not been performed sufficiently to date. So the
nonlinear elastic response of the MgO is first studied by calculating the
second-, third-, and fourth-order elastic constants. Results show that our
predications on the high-order elastic constants exhibit excellent agreement
with the available experimental ones and other theoretical values, which
indicates that the present computational approach is suitable for the
calculations of the high-order elastic constants and it can be expanded into
other complex systems. Then on the basis of the elastic constants, the related
anharmonic properties such as the first-order pressure derivatives of the
second- and third-order elastic constants, Gruneisen constants of the long-
wavelength acoustic modes, and ultrasonic nonlinear parameters are also
investigated. The predications on the anharmonic properties first given in the
present work are hoped to serve as a valuable guidance or reference for further
related investigations.

Kinetics and Mechanism of the Simultaneous Carbothermic Reduction of FeO and MnO
MnO-12.1 pct CaO-5.4 pct MgO-9.3 pct Al2O3-24.1 pct SiO2-10.4 pct FeO slag in Ar
at was studied using the sessile drop wettability technique. Pure graphite,
coke, and charcoal were used as the carbon material substrates. The reduction
rates were evaluated by sampling at different reduction times and by analyzing
the chemical compositions of the reduced slag and the produced metal. The
carbothermic FeO reduction from slag is initially fast followed by a much slower
reduction rate. However, the rate of the MnO reduction is slow in the fast FeO
reduction stage, and it starts to increase significantly during the slow FeO
reduction stage. The kinetics of FeO and MnO reduction are affected by the type
of carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the rate of the carbon dissolution/transfer
into the produced metal phase and the amount of the transferred manganese to the
metal phase depend on the type of carbon. Based on the experimental observations
and the thermodynamic calculations, a mechanism for MnO reduction was proposed.
According to this mechanism, MnO is mainly reduced through a metallothermic
reduction by Fe and the rate of MnO reduction is controlled by the rate of the
consumption of FeO from the slag, which takes place simultaneously. In contrast,
the rate of FeO reduction in the fast initial reduction stage is controlled by
the rate of the carbon dissolution/transfer into the metal phase. However, at
the second slow FeO reduction stage, it is reduced mainly by the solid carbon.

K1.85Na0.15Ti4O9:xCu 0 x 0.8 have been prepared using high temperature solid
state reaction. Room temperature X-ray diffratograms confirm the phase
evolution. Room temperature electron paramagnetic resonance EPR data show that
Cu occupies Ti lattice sites giving rise to electric dipoles which increases
electric permittivity. The absorption peak in EPR spectra gets broadened due to
increased exchange interaction in heavily doped derivatives. Dielectric data
reveal that occupancy of Cu on Ti leads to a decrease in dielectric losses and
an increase in the electric permittivity as well.

of this phenomenon was studied on hot workability of the alloy. The incipient
melting was detected to be within the temperature range, which has been reported
to be the standard temperature range of solution annealing of this material. The
local melted regions were enriched in Zr, Nb and B elements, which appeared in
the form of three different phases. The results also showed that even small
amounts of local melted regions impair hot workability of the alloy. The use of
long time solution annealing at or a two-step solution heat treatment has been
recommended to delay the incipient melting of the alloy. These treatments
enhance hot workability of the alloy.

Production of Titanium Nitride by Carbothermic Reduction of the Anatase and
Rutile Forms of Titanium Dioxide. Two types of titanium oxide were used, rutile
&gt;99.9% TiO2 and anatase &gt;99% TiO2. Both samples were mixed with graphite
in accordance with the required stoichiometry, and then milled in a tumbling
mill for 50 hours in an argon atmosphere to ensure thorough mixing. The mill
to ball mass ratio of 1:43. After milling, samples were heated to in an alumina
crucible at min-1 under a flowing nitrogen 100 mL min-1 atmosphere in a
thermogravimetric analyser TGA. Srilankite was detected in the as-milled anatase
sample but the anatase to rutile transformation was not completed during
milling. After heating to most of the anatase had transformed to rutile.
Reduction of anatase started just below whilst rutile underwent reduction below.
TGA results showed that the anatase reduction was more complex than the rutile
reduction with several stages evident between 880 and in the anatase sample
whilst only two steps were observed for rutile. The initial identified products
were Ti5O9 and Ti4O7 prior to TiN in anatase sample but in rutile sample only
Ti4O7 was detected. Reduction was completed in rutile sample before whilst in
anatase completed at. TiN was the final product in both systems after heating
to. These results are discussed in light of recent work demonstrating the
different reductions paths of rutile and anatase.

Residual stress and damage development in the aluminium alloy EN AW-6061
particle reinforced with Al2O3 under thermal fatigue loading. Thermal fatigue TF
tests were performed on the aluminium alloy EN AW-6061-T6, non-reinforced and
reinforced with 15 and 22vol.% Al2O3 particles, respectively. Thewere produced
by stir casting followed by hot extrusion. Thermal fatigue tests were performed
using a 6kW diode laser with a beam area of about 8mm8mm focused on the centre
of one flat side of disc shaped specimens. The reverse side was either attached
to a water-cooled aluminium plate or directly cooled by water. The maximum
temperature Tmax of the irradiated side was varied between 573 and. The heating
rate was/s. Residual stresses in the matrix alloy were measured by X-ray
diffraction using the sin2-method after T6 heat treatment and after defined
temperature cycles. Initial residual compressive stresses between 20 and 65MPa
result from the machining processes before T6 heat treatment. During the first
temperature cycle the residual stresses in all materials change to tension at
almost all Tmax. The peak value of the residual stresses reaches 50 up to 65MPa
and is nearly independent from Tmax. Damage evolution was observed by light
optical microscope and SEM after the same cycles as the residual stress
measurements. Grain boundary reliefs arise and increase in all materials with
increasing number of TF cycles and intergranular damage of EN AW-6061 and the
matrix alloy of theis observed. Close to the particles, damage is more
pronounced due to thermal and mechanical mismatch of the phases. Four mechanisms
causing damage and residual stress development could be identified: thermally
induced global deformation due to inhomogeneous distribution of temperature,

Fracture mechanisms of fiber-reinforced titanium alloy matrix composites Part
IV: Low cycle fatigue. The low cycle fatigue behavior and mechanisms of fatigue
damage initiation and propagation of several SCS-6 fiber-reinforced titatnium
alloy composites at room temperature were investigated. The fatigue damage
diagram was constructed using the maximum stress in the fiber vs. fatigue life.
Depending on the stress levels applied, the fatigue damage of the composites can
be classified into three regions: 1 fiber breakage dominated, 2 interfacial
cracking, matrix cracking and fiber breakage dominated progressive and 3 matrix
cracking dominated. The microstructural parametes which affect the low cycle
fatigue behavior of these composites are also discussed.

Study of safe factor of sintered aluminium alloys using extrusion process. :
Powder metallurgy manufacturing route has wide industrial applications due to
economic advantages. Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low density and for
its ability to resist corrosion due to the phenomenon of passivation and also it
is known that the structural components of aluminium and its alloys are vital to
the aerospace industry and are important in other areas of transportation and
structural materials. So, the most useful compound of aluminium, at least on a
weight basis, is the oxides and sulfates. Therefore the selected composition of
powder mix is compacted, with the resultant shapes heated or sintered in a
controlled atmosphere furnace to bond the particles and then extruded. The
tensile specimens which are prepared from extrudates are tested. The high
precision formation capability of PM generates components with near net shape,
intricate features and good dimensional precision pieces. The results were good
at all the stages and this present study reveals the estimation of safe factor
with respect to working stress and ultimate tensile stress.

Relating fracture mechanics and fatigue lifetime prediction. This article
presents how to link together the results of fatigue crack growth tests,
analytic fracture mechanics and experimental methods of fatigue lifetime
predictions. The study at the beginning investigates the effect of mechanical
load redistribution among failed and intact micro-structural bonds along fatigue
crack growth to final crack at vulnerable locations in materials and structures
under cyclic loads. The microstructural load redistribution model is
analytically formulated as a mechanical interaction between fatigue crack growth
and fatigue endurance on the macroscopic level. The article in continuation
investigates how to link the parameters of fatigue crack growth in fracture
mechanics to parameters of fatigue life directly from the work done on crack
growth determined by testing. The article at the end illustrates the application
of the analytic procedure for fatigue lifetime prediction that combines fracture
mechanics and the load redistribution model for determination of SN curve
parameters important in structural analysis and design. In this research the
fatigue life time parameters are derived from a single fatigue crack growth
experiment instead from normally required sets of fatigue tests for different
loading conditions.

Vibro-Acoustic Characterization and Optimization of Periodic Cellular Material
Structures PCMS for NVH Applications. NVHNoise, vibration, and harshness
performance has been identified as having a significant influence in the
purchase considerations of most automobile purchasers. Periodic cellular
material structures PCMS are recently introduced multi-functional structures,
commonly in sandwich form, that facilitate a wide variety of engineering
purposes. Although literature concerning many PCMS properties is abundant,
information about their vibration and acoustic responses is scanty, to the best
knowledge of the present authors. This article documents a basic investigation
of the vibration and acoustic behaviors of some PCMS through practical,
analytical and numerical approaches, in order to evaluate the possibilities for
minimizing, the transmission of noise and vibration. Some of these materials
were made and investigated over frequency ranges which include several commonly-
encountered vibration and acoustic frequencies of automotive and some other
structures. Observations from this work are therefore expected to contribute
towards design inputs to obtain better performances. A novel investigation of
the effects upon vibration response of even slight inaccuracies of cutting out
samples from larger blanks of such materials has also been made.

LDA+U calculated electronic and structural properties of NiO001 and NiO111 p22
surfaces. In this work, the reconstruction effects for NiO001 and oxygen
terminated NiO111 p22 surfaces have been investigated. The projector augmented
wave method together with the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics scheme have been
used to determine the atomic geometry and electronic ground state. The
correlation effects of the Ni d electrons are treated using a meanfield multi-
orbital Hubbard correction, the so-called LDA+ U approximation, to the local
spin density Hamiltonian where LDA stands for the local-density approximation
and U for the Hubbard interaction. The LDA+ U calculation shows that the
reconstruction effects as well as the changes of the electronic structure of the
NiO001 surface are small compared to the unreconstructed surface. On the
contrary, the oxygen-terminated NiO111 p22 polar surface exhibits important
reconstruction effects and changes of the electronic structure, that provide
additional stabilization of this polar surface.

Characterization of HDH Titanium Powder for Biomaterial Applications. Several
materials have been used as surgical implants since the 16th century. Materials
can be implanted in the human body; however, the choice of the appropriate
material is based on the required mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological
chromium-molybdenum alloys became known as materials for implant applications.
They were considered suitable for surgical implant procedures but many
researchers and surgeons were not completely satisfied with their performance.
The main problem of the modern science is to find a material that perfectly
restores tissues damaged after accidents or diseases. The trend of the current
research in orthopedic prosthesis is based on the development of titanium alloys
composed of non-toxic elements with low modulus of elasticity. Powder metallurgy
techniques have beenused to produce controlled porous structures such as the
porous coating applied for dental and orthopedic surgical implants which allows
bone tissue grown within the implant surface, improving fixation. The
development of porous metallic biomaterials associated with their biomedical
applications is an important research area. To obtain a good one implant
successful therapy the composition, size, form and topography of the alloys are
extremely important.

Facile fabrication of three-dimensional interconnected nanoporous NTiO2 for
efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting. Three-dimensional 3D
interconnected porous architectures are expected to perform well in
photoelectrochemical PEC water splitting due to their high specific surface area
as well as favourable porous properties and interconnections. In this work, we
demonstrated the facile fabrication of 3D interconnected nanoporous N-doped
TiO2NTiO2 network by annealing the anodized 3D interconnected nanoporous
TiO2TiO2 network in ammonia atmosphere. The obtained NTiO2 network exhibited
broadened light absorption, and abundant, interconnected pores for improving
charge separation, which was supported by the reduced charge transfer
resistance. With these merits, a remarkably high photocurrent density at 1.23V
vs. reversible hydrogen electrode RHE was realized for the NTiO2 network without
any co-catalysts or sacrificial reagents, and the photostability can be assured
after long term illumination. In view of its simplicity and efficiency, this
structure promises for perspective PEC applications.

Solid Galvanic Wastes Incorporation in Glass Matrices. Among the industrial
solid residues, the galvanic wastes have been received special attention, due to
the nature of its components. These residues in general present a high
concentration of alkaline and transition metals. When discarded or stored
inadequately, they can be released for the environment, causing ecological and
health damages. An interesting alternative to recycle those wastes is to remove
them from the environment, through its incorporation in silicate glasses
matrices. This work proposes the obtaining of amorphous structures, glasses or
frits, from formulations with industrial solid galvanic wastes, with good
chemical stability. A characterization study of the residue and primary
materials, as commercial silica and feldspar and investigations about the
formation of amorphous phases, galvanic wastes incorporation and chemical
stability of the obtained products, were made. With these results, it was
possible to formulate compositions that allow the obtaining of frits for ceramic
enamels, with 23 % in weight of solid galvanic waste incorporated and good
coating characteristics.

metal or sulphide with reactive para -xylylene monomer vapours at. Electric
conductivity of the films was studied during the components co-condensation,
upon sample annealing in range and maintaining at constant temperature. With a
rise of metal nanoparticles in the polymer matrix, the conductivity tends to
increase. The conductivity may be determined as a tunnel transfer of charge from

Surface tension measurements on pure liquid iron and nickel by an oscillating

tension of molten metals has been developed. It is based on the Rayleigh
equation which relates frequency and surface tension for an oscillating drop. A
systematic study has shown this equation to be valid for a liquid metal droplet
levitated electromagnetically in an inert flowing gas with no prior calibration
required. It is, therefore, an absolute method. The frequencies of oscillation
of droplets of pure iron and nickel in a 6 pct H2He gas mixture were measured by
high speed cinematography. Surface tensions were obtained for temperatures of
1550 to for iron and 1475 to for nickel.

Study of Zeolite Usage in Thermal Degradation Process of Polypropylene
Pyrolysis. Plastics materials have been an integral part in peoples daily life
due to their high elasticity, formability and lightweight characteristics which
are suitable for many products. However, exponentially growth of plastics waste
leads to heavy environmental problems due to the plastics nature which is not
easily degradable. One of solution to alleviate environmental problems due to
plastics waste is to use pyrolysis method to burn plastics waste and convert
them into lighter hydrocarbon which can be used as a source of energy. In this
final project, the addition of zeolite catalyst in pyrolysis process of
Polypropylene plastic waste has been studied in the terms of energy activation.
Isoconversional Friedman and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods were used. The results may

A Statistical RKR Fracture Model for the Brittle Fracture of Functionally Graded
Materials. A statistical Ritchie-Knott-Rice RKR 1 model for brittle fracture is
considered for an FGM containing a slender notch. The FMG is modeled as linear
elastic, with its strength described by two-parameter Weibull statistics. The
Young's modulus is assumed to vary either linearly or sigmoidally. A compact
tension CT fracture mechanics specimen is analyzed via the finite element
method, considering the effect of modulus variation on the near-tip stress
state. Results can be characterized by the stress intensity, K. For spatially
constant Weibull parameters, the RKR model is used to predict the expected
fracture toughness, K ,e., the K at which the first flaw failure occurs with
probability . For sufficiently high Weibull modulus, the failure occurs
essentially at the notch tip. For sufficiently low Weibull modulus m < 4, K for
an FGM is found to vary up to 25% from that of a homogeneous body.

Label-free detection of DNA by a dielectric modulated armchair-graphene
nanoribbon FET based biosensor in a dual-nanogap setup. A Double-Gate Armchair-
Graphene Nanoribbon FET is proposed to realize a high-sensitive and small-size
biosensor in order to detect DNA without high-cost and time-consuming labeling
process. Two nanogap cavities open inside the top and bottom gate oxides by the
method of sacrificed layer etching. When the DNA biomolecule is introduced to
the nanogap cavity, the hybridization event which is actually the formation of a
double-strand of DNA will occur thus electrically modulating the GNR channel
leading to a change in the drain current. The important report of this research
is about attained high sensitivity of the proposed biosensor for a vast spectrum
of the DNA biological samples. It is worth noting that a DNA sequence by 23
nucleotides extracted from Neisseria gonorrhoeae can be detected as a special
case. An extensive numerical approach has been applied in order to characterize
the proposed biosensor. The suggested biosensor has been evaluated by solving
Schrodinger equation SE with Non-Equilibrium Green Function NEGF method in the
mode-space coupled into Poisson solver in a self-consistent manner assuming
ballistic limit. Two different expressions of sensitivity in terms of the
threshold voltage and current have been defined giving a good metric for the
sensitivity analysis. The results revealed a relative sensitivity of 1mV/nm2 by
a filled area by the DNA about 120nm2 showing the excellent superiority for the
proposed biosensor as compared to other counterparts. The effective area of the
proposed biosensor obtains 240nm2 which is very small in comparison with other
reports highlighting high capability of the biosensor in the detection. It has
been shown that the proposed biosensor can be implemented in ultra-scaling
domain resulting in considerable increase in the sensitivity promising a potent
and reliable candidate for high-sensitive and small-size biosensors. Also, the
technical issues on designing the suggested biosensor have been investigated to
achieve a useful guideline in detection and identification of the target

Effect of Stirring Vapor Phase on the Formation and Structural Features of
Pyrolytic Graphite. The preparation of graphites has been worked by pyrolysis of
propane gas on a directly heated substrate in the vapor phase stirred by a fan.
Its formation process and structural features microstructure, density, and
crystal structure were examined on several samples deposited under various
conditions at deposition temperatures of 1440, 1730,, gas pressures of 10, 25,
50mmHg, and gas flow rate of 640cm3/min. The effect of stirring vapor phase is
appreciable at high temperatures and high pressures. The convection of the
decomposed gases or gaseous products disappears in the stirred vapor phase. It
follows that the abnormal behavior observed in the pressure range of 2030mmHg as
described in a previous paper is restored to its normal behavior. The formation
process in the stirred vapor phase is discussed in relation to the change in the
structural features under the gas pressure.

size 100,240,350,510and 670um of eggshell particles to aluminum powder. It
samples was composed by using pressing of single action then accompanied
directly by process of sintering at under the inert gas effect conditions. it
was concluded that the best hardening of 72.6971 Mpa can be obtained when the
variables were Xi = 12 wt% and X2 =100um. The lights value of Xi and X2,
obtained using the programs, was used in practice giving hardening 74Mpa which
it nearly similar to that obtained by program. Also results show that the

hardening. Moreover, the hardening increases with increasing weight fraction.
While hardening value decreases gradient with down eggshell particle size.

Coarse grain modeling of spall failure in molecular crystals: role of intra-
molecular degrees of freedom. We use a recently developed thermodynamically
accurate mesodynamical method Strachan and Holian 2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 94
014301 where groups of atoms are represented by mesoparticles to characterize
the shock compression and dynamical failure spall of a model molecular crystal.
We characterize how the temperature rise caused by the shockwave depends on the
specific heat of the degrees of freedom DoFs internal to the mesoparticles Cint
and the strength of the coupling between the internal DoFs and the
mesoparticles. We find that the temperature of the shocked material decreases
with increasing Cint and decreasing coupling and quantify these effects. Our
simulations also show that the threshold for plastic deformation the Hugoniot
elastic limit depends on the properties of the internal DoFs while the threshold
for failure is very insensitive to them. These results have implications on the
results of all-atom MD simulations, whose classical nature leads to a
significant overestimation of the specific heat of molecular materials.

High-Temperature Superconducting Cable Design Based on Individual Insulated
Conductors. The idea of insulating individual high-temperature superconducting
HTS tapes was explored as a dielectric design to reduce the risk and complexity
of HTS cable manufacturing. Applying insulation on individual HTS tapes is
amenable to continuous manufacturing processes and opens up material choices for
the insulation. In this study, heat shrink insulation was selected as the
material choice for exploring the possibility of this design philosophy because
of its commercial availability in multiple thicknesses. A systematic set of
selection criteria was developed for the selection of appropriate heat shrink
for given HTS tape dimensions. The cryogenic dielectric characteristics of
insulated HTS tapes were evaluated both in liquid nitrogen and gaseous helium
environments at. Dielectric characteristics of tapes with a single layer of
thicker insulation were compared with those insulated using multiple layers of
thinner insulation to evaluate the relative merits of each method. Several model
power cables were fabricated using the PET insulated tapes, and their dielectric
behavior was evaluated at in gaseous helium environment. The results suggest
that the explored method is useful for HTS power cables operating at low
voltages &lt;1,000 V primarily due to the limitation on achieving thick
insulation with high quality using heat shrink tubing. The suitable processes of
insulating longer lengths of samples with additional dielectric benefits are
discussed.

The growth of N-doped carbon nanotube arrays on sintered Al2O3 substrates.
Vertically oriented bamboo-like nitrogen-containing carbon nanotube CNT arrays
were grown on an alumina Al2O3 substrate by the injection chemical vapor
deposition CVD process using ethanol as a carbon source and ethylenediamine as a
nitrogen source. The substrate is a sintered Al2O3 plate with a rough surface
consisting of polycrystalline Al2O3 micro-grains. The concentration of ferrocene
in ethanol played a major role in the growth of CNT arrays. Aligned multi-walled
CNT arrays were obtained under optimized catalyst concentrations 0.015g/ml and
growth temperature 900C with the height of the arrays attaining 160m after the
growth for 1h. The growth of CNT occurred predominately between 30 and 40min and
ceased growth beyond 60min. X-ray photoelectronic spectrum detects the
incorporation of nitrogen atoms in thewith an atomic ratio of 1.2%. The present
study indicates that it is possible to grow high quality carbon nanotube arrays
over a cheap alumina substrate of a rough surface.

Chemorheological Study on Vulcanized Rubbers under Mechanical-Curve Treatment.
When vulcanized rubber is strained by external force at lower temperature,g.
lower than its glass transition temperature, it is considered that there occurs
cleavage in the network of polymer chains. When natural rubber has been strained
by external force to 200% of its original bulk at -70C, and is left in nitrogen
at room temperature for about four hours, its cross-linking density increases
about 17% as high. The relation between the cross-linking density and the rate
of deformation due to the strain shows the Maxwellian type.Experiments have
revealed the fact, on the other hand, that when vulcanized rubber is impregnated
with radical acceptor its cross-linking density gets remarkably reduced in the
rate of increment.It is conceivable, all things considered, that some mechanical
reaction has taken place on the degraded rubber radicals to recombine.

High resolution X-ray diffraction and X-ray topography study of GaN on sapphire.
High resolution X-ray diffraction and X-ray topography study of GaN thin films,
grown on sapphire 11.0 substrate by reduced pressure metalorganic vapor phase
epitaxy MOVPE under various conditions, were performed. The strained lattice
parameters, stress, misorientation and dislocation density of GaN films were
estimated. The experimental stress compares well with the theoretical stress
obtained from the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the
film and substrate. The dislocation density was found to be highest in the
thinner GaN film. It was also higher in the film without any buffer layer. For
the same carrier concentration, the mobility of one of the film was lower than
the other which could be due to the presence of higher dislocation density. Slip
lines associated with dislocations, stacking faults, cellular structure of
dislocations and double positioning boundaries were found in the X-ray
topography from the GaN films.

Optimized Design of an ECAP Die Using the Finite Element Method for Obtaining
Nanostructured Materials. An alloy type A16060 was exposed to severe plastic
deformation to study its reaction using the finite element method FEM. To
perform this, six different configurations were used in the design of the dies
channel for ECAP equal channel angular pressing to obtain nanostructure
materials and to optimize the process. Thanks to simulation performed with FEM,
it is possible to study the homogeneity in the deformation due to the variation
of conditions affecting directly the material being processed using the ECAP
technique, such as the friction coefficient, extrusion speed, and mainly the
dies channel geometry being utilized in the ECAP process. Due to the tensile
strain area being located mainly in the upper part of the deformed test cylinder
plastic deformation area which increases the fracture and cracking tendency
preventing the processing through ECAP the die being utilized was modified to
eliminate the tensile strain area favoring the appearance of compressive stress
which reduces the cracking tendency and the fracture of the sample being
processed. The FEM analysis demonstrated that the strain state changed
significantly from tension to compression when the modified die was used,
facilitating the processing of the piece by ECAP.

Interfacial Assembly of Two Gemini-Type Schiff Base Amphiphiles with Aromatic
Spacers in Organized Molecular Films. Gemini amphiphiles have been widely
investigated in many aspects due to the unique structure. In this study, two
gemini-type Schiff base amphiphiles containing aromatic spacers were synthesized
and characterized in Langmuir-Blodgett films. Both compounds formed stable
multilayer films and showed distinct phase behaviours on water surface and ion
subphase. When the compounds spread on Cu2+ ions subphase, an in-situ
coordination occurred for both ligands. While spectral measurements confirmed
the coordination with Cu2+ ions and aggregation mode, the morphological
investigations showed the distinct nanostructures and molecular rearrangement
depended on the molecular spacers and aggregation modes. For both process, the
aromatic spacers in gemini amphiphiles have predominant effect in regulating the
aggregation modes and spectral changes in organized molecular films.

High temperature deformation behavior of closed cell ZnAl27 hybrid foam made
through stir casting technique. Closed cell ZnAl27 hybrid foam was synthesized
through stir casting technique using CaH20.5 wt% as foaming agent and cenosphere
particles were used as thickening agent and to create microporosity into the
final structure. The relative density of the synthesized hybrid foam was found
in the range of 0.200.30. Microstructural characterization was carried out to
find distribution of cenosphere particles into the cell wall of hybrid foam.
Compression tests were carried out to find out the effect of temperature,
relative density and strain rate on the deformation behavior of the foam. It was
found that each foamed sample displays three regionse., linear elastic, plateau
and densification respectively. On the basis of stress-strain curves obtained at
varying relative density, strain rate and temperature the values of plateau
stress, energy absorption capacity and densification strain were calculated. It
was found that according to the increase in relative density and strain rate the
plateau stress and energy absorption capacity also increased. The effect of
temperature on plateau stress and energy absorption capacity for lower relative
density was more as compared to the higher relative density. The densification
strain was almost invariant 0.020.03 on varying strain rate for the same
relative density.

Diffusion of ion-implanted boron impurities into pre-amorphized silicon. Boron
ion implantation into pre-amorphized silicon is studied. Pre-amorphization is
performed either by F + or Si + implantation prior to B + implantation at 10keV
with 310 15 ions/cm 2 . Broadening of the boron profile can be suppressed
markedly in the pre-amorphized layers. For instance, the as-implanted depth at a
B concentration of 110 18 atoms/cm 3 decreases from 0.19 to 0.1m for
implantation into a pre-amorphized layer compared to B implantation into
crystalline silicon. After annealing at, B atoms diffuse much more rapidly in
the pre-amorphized layers than in the crystalline silicon case. Nevertheless,
shallower junctions are obtained with the use of pre-amorphization. For dual F +
and B + implantation at F + doses above 110 15 F + /cm 2 , fluorine is found to
segregate to the peak of the boron profile during annealing. Fluorine is also
trapped at the peak of the as-implanted fluorine profile peak and near the
amorphouscrystalline interface. The effects of fluorine dose and anneal
temperature on the F precipitation are described and compared to results for BF
+ 2 implants.

nanoparticles, which were synthesized by co-precipitation method. The mean grain
size of the nanoparticles was about 24.7 nm. The nanoparticles were sintered
at,, and, respectively, for 30 min under a uniaxial pressure of 30 MPa and
vacuum of 103 Pa with 1 mol % lithium fluoride LiF as sintering additive. The 5
mol % Er:CaF2 ceramics sintered at exhibits high density and pore-free
microstructure with an average grain size of about 8 m. The optical
transmittance of the transparent ceramics is close to 85 % at visible and
nearinfrared wavelengths. The strong and broad absorptions peaks corresponding
to characteristic absorption of trivalent erbium ions make the ceramics a
potential candidate for infrared and upconversion laser operating.

The use of abrasive polishing and laser processing for developing polyurethane
surfaces for controlling fibroblast cell behaviour. Studies have shown that
surfaces having micro and nano-scale features can be used to control cell
behaviours including; cell proliferation, migration and adhesion. The aim of
this work was to compare the use of laser processing and abrasive polishing to
develop micro/nano-patterned polyurethane substrates for controlling fibroblast
cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. Laser processing in a directional
manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having a ploughed field effect with
micron-scale features. In contrast, abrasive polishing in a directional and
random manner resulted in polyurethane surfaces having sub-micron scale features
orientated in a linear or random manner. Results show that when compared with
flat non-patterned polymer, both the laser processed and abrasive polished
surface having randomly organised features, promoted significantly greater cell
adhesion, while also enhancing cell proliferation after 72h. In contrast, the
abrasive polished surface having linear features did not enhance cell adhesion
or proliferation when compared to the flat surface. For cell migration, the
cells growing on the laser processed and abrasively polished random surface
showed decreased levels of migration when compared to the flat surface. This
study shows that both abrasive polishing and laser processing can be used to
produce surfaces having features on the nano-scale and micron-scale,
respectively. Surfaces produced using both techniques can be used to promote
fibroblast cell adhesion and proliferation. Thus both methods offer a viable
alternative to using lithographic techniques for developing patterned surfaces.
In particular, abrasive polishing is an attractive method due to it being a
simple, rapid and inexpensive method that can be used to produce surfaces having
features on a comparable scale to more expensive, multi-step methods.

Powder Diffraction of Components Subject to Corrosion in Fuse Cutouts with
Ceramic Insulation. Aiming identification of the components most affected by
corrosion under saline environment conditions, we have carried out X-ray
diffraction measurements in ceramic and bond materials, all in the powder form.
The ceramic is analyzed before and after thermal annealing at, showing the same
DRX peaks, although better defined after annealing. Identification suggests the
presence of Al6Si2O13 Mullite and SiO2 Quartz. Analysis of the junction bond
material shows similar peaks, but a metallic preponderance is observed. Thermal
annealing of the junction is done at much lower temperature, because it melts in
the range-170C, when a whitish smoke begins to show up along with strong sulfur
odor.

Isotropic Channel Mobility inon 4HSiCCFace with Vicinal Off-Angle. UMOSFET is
theoretically suitable to decrease the on-resistance of the MOSFET. In this
study, in order to determine the cell structure of the SiCUMOSFET with extremely
low on-resistance, influences of the orientation of the trench and the off-angle
of the wafer on the MOS properties are investigated. The channel resistance,
gate IV curves and instability of threshold voltage are superior on the {11-20}
planes as compared with other planes. On the vicinal off wafer, influence of the
off-angle disappears and the properties on the equivalent planes are almost the
same. The obtained results indicate that the extremely low on-resistance with
the high stability and high reliability is possible in the SiCUMOSFET by the
hexagonal cell composed of the six {11-20} planes on the vicinal off wafer, and
actually an extremely low channel resistance was demonstrated on the hexagonal

Influence of La on the crystallisation behaviour of amorphous 7 alloys. Melt
spun and subsequently annealed Al-alloys with 6 at.% Ni and 47 at.% La were
investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry XRD. XRD
reveals that the ribbons are fully amorphous in the as melt spun state. DSC
shows that crystallisation proceeds in two stages which are sensitively
influenced by the La content. The first stage compromises the formation of
either fcc-Al at low La content or a bcc phase at high La concentration of yet
unknown composition. Micro hardness changes significantly during annealing and
can be correlated to the different stages of microstructural transformation as
observed by XRD.

Refinement of Mg alloys crystal structure via Nb-based heterogeneous substrates
for improved performances. Lightness and high specific strength make magnesium
alloys ideal materials for the transportation industry, especially the
automotive sector that is struggling to cope with the everyday more stringent
regulations on emission of carbon dioxide. Wrought magnesium alloys are
difficult to deform because of the few active slip systems characteristic of
their hexagonal close-packed lattice. Consequently, most of the commercially
available magnesium alloys are alloys based on the MgAl binary system used in
casting processes. The improvement of the mechanical properties of these alloys
cannot be achieved by means of grain refinement using Zr due to the formation of
Zr aluminides. In this study we propose a novel chemical composition that can
refine all types of Mg alloys as proved in the Al-containing AM50 Mg alloy. We
demonstrate that NbB inoculation of Mg alloys promotes the formation of
heterogeneously nucleated primary -Mg grains leading to the reduction of the
grain size and this is obtained over a wide range of cooling rates. We also show
that the grain refinement achieved leads to the improvement of the properties of
high pressure die cast Mg automotive components and has the potential to enhance
the mechanical properties of cast Mg alloys.

Osteoblast cell behavior on the new beta-type Ti25Ta25Nb alloy. Among metallic
materials used as bone substitutes, titanium alloys gain an increasing
importance because of their low modulus, high corrosion resistance and good
biocompatibility. In this work, an investigation of the in vitro
cytocompatibility of a recently new developed -type Ti-25Ta-25Nb alloy was
carried out by evaluating the behavior of human osteoblasts. The metallic
Ti-6Al-4V biomaterial, which is one of representative + type titanium alloys for
biomedical applications, and Tissue Culture Polystyrene TCPS, were also
investigated as reference Ti-based material and control substrate, respectively.
Both metallic surfaces were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, atomic force
microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The cellular response was
quantified by assessments of viability, cell attachment and spreading, cell
morphology, production and extracellular organization of fibronectin and cell
proliferation. Polished surfaces from both materials having an equiaxed grain
microstructure and nanometre scale surface roughness elicited an essentially
identical osteoblast response in terms of all analyzed cellular parameters.
Thus, on both surfaces the cells displayed high survival rates, good cell
adhesion and spreading, a dense and randomly dispersed fibronectin matrix and
increasing cell proliferation rates over the incubation time. Furhermore, the
enhanced biological performance of Ti-25Ta-25Nb was highly supported by the
results obtained in comparison with TCPS. These findings, together with
previously shown superelastic behavior, low Young's modulus and high corrosion
resistance, recommend Ti-25Ta-25Nb as good candidate for applications in bone
implantology.

Viscoplastic behaviour of perovskite type ferroelectrics. We present a
viscoplastic rate-dependent constitutive model describing both hysteretic and
sub-coercive behaviour of ferroelectric ceramics. Viscoplastic models employ
rate equations for the volume fractions of orientation variants along with a
distribution function for grain orientations, providing a statistical
macroscopic description for the processes of polarization reversal in
polycrystalline ferroelectrics. Here attention is focused on two viscoplastic
models for perovskite type ferroelectrics undergoing a cubic-to-tetragonal phase
transition. Both models incorporate 90 and 180 domain switching, but differ in a
number of representative domain orientations, which is 6 and 42, respectively.
Different parameterisations for the models were tested, with a special emphasis
on orientation effects in the behaviour of poled ferroelectrics under multi-
axial loading as well as on rate effects. Simulation of the polarization
rotation in soft PZT ceramics by electric field applied at an angle to the
original poling direction show good agreement between the predictions of the
viscoplastic model and experimental data.

added to enhance the photocatalytic properties of resulting films. Effects of
experimental variables on the photocatalytic properties of the coatings were
evaluated based on the degradation efficiency of the reference dye Methylene
blue. The photocatalytic activity of resulting TiO2 coatings was improved with
the loading of TiO2 powder Degussa, P25 and PEG in the sols. The electron-hole
pair photogeneration increases with the energy of irradiation and improves
photocatalytic efficiency. Increasing coating thickness leads to a rough surface
with more reaction sites. Photodegradation conversion of Methylene blue Mb

cutting process. Although the airarc cutting process has been widely used in the
material processing engineering, little information about temperature, stress
and microstructure in the plate airarc cut is known. A three-dimensional finite
element model including the material removal and the thermal effect of the arc
plate during airarc cutting process in this paper. The microstructures and
micro-mechanical properties of the parts near the groove especially in heat
affected zone HAZ are studied by experimental methods, and they also can be used
as a method to verify the numerical results. Effects of stresses induced by
airarc cutting process on the initial residual stress fields of base materials
are also researched. The results show that the cooling velocity in HAZ is higher
than the one of the welding process for the same base material, and the zone
with high temperature is very narrow, which means that the temperature gradients
near the groove are very steep during the airarc cutting process; this special
temperature field depresses multiphase transformations and coarse
microstructures. The evolution of the stress during the airarc cutting is
described, and the numerical results indicate that the characteristics of the
evolution of stresses and the residual stresses distribution in the plate in
airarc cutting process seem to be similar to the ones of the butt welding for
flat plates. The influences of airarc cutting process on initial stress fields
present two aspects: thermal effect and material removal effect, and the former
plays a primary role. Both numerical temperature and stress fields are compared
with the experimental ones. It is very important for researchers to clarify the
temperatures, stresses and microstructures in the plate during airarc cutting
process, and understand fully the mechanism of influences of airarc cutting on
the plate; it is also very valuable for engineering application of the airarc
cutting process.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Anisotropic Corrosion-Induced Stress in
tensile stress, leading to stress corrosion cracking SCC. Anisotropic corrosion-
induced stress of Fe single crystal is studied by molecular dynamics MD in this
paper. The surface perpendicular to the z direction is subjected to the
corrosion, and the process of corrosion along three crystallographic directions
is simulated using MD approach. When the surface with one specific orientation
is corroded, two cases are considered: one is that the periodic boundary
condition is applied along the x direction, while free boundary condition along
the y direction; and the other is that the periodic boundary condition along the
y direction, while free boundary condition along the x direction. The results
show that both the deflection of the free end and the macro tensile stress of
the crystal for the corrosion in three crystallographic orientations are
increasing with the increase of the relative depth of the porous layer. The
values of the deflection and the macro tensile stress for the two cases depend
on the orientation with the free boundary condition when the surface with one
specific orientation is corroded. Moreover, the smaller the interplanar spacing
along the orientation with the free boundary condition is, the larger the
deflection and the macro tensile stress are.

Diffraction Contrast Tomography - A Synchrotron Radiation Technique for Mapping
Polycrystalline Microstructures in 3D. In this paper the authors describe a
technique based on synchrotron x-ray diffraction which has been used to produce
full 3D grain maps both grain shapes and orientations in annealed aluminium
termed diffraction contrast tomography DCT, reflecting its similarities with
conventional absorption contrast tomography. It is an extension of the 3D X-ray
diffraction microscopy 3DXRD concept, and has been developed in collaboration
with its inventors. The specimen is illuminated using a monochromatic
synchrotron x-ray beam, and grains imaged using the extinction contrast that
appears in the transmitted beam when grains are aligned in the diffraction
condition during rotation of the sample. The beams of radiation diffracted by
the grains are captured simultaneously on the same detector as the direct beam
image. The combination of diffraction and extinction information aids the grain
indexing operation, in which pairs of diffraction and extinction images are
assigned to grain sets. 3D grain shapes are determined by algebraic
reconstruction from the limited number of extinction projections, while
crystallographic orientation is found from the diffraction geometry. The non-
destructive nature of the technique allows for in-situ studies of mapped
samples. Research is in progress to extend the technique to allow the
determination of the elastic strain and stress tensors on a grain-by-grain
basis.

structure evolution, texture development and tensile properties are studied
using EBSD, TEM and tensile tests. Microstructure evolution studies show the
grain structure coarsens by enhancing the Brass texture during increase of
rolling reduction and a unique single crystal-like brass-texture deformed
structure is achieved after 80% rolling reduction. We found the deformation
mechanism of partial slip by a 6 211 dislocations facilitated by the pinning of
a 2 101 perfect dislocations through fine oxide particles is responsible for
formation of Brass texture during room temperature rolling. Furthermore, the
recrystallization of ODS copper retards to high temperature of ~700C and shows a
fine-grained microstructure with different orientations of Goss, Brass, S and
Copper. Evaluation of microstructure-mechanical properties of the recrystallized
samples expresses that the bimodal grain size distribution at for 30min offers a
good tensile strength-ductility UTS: 491MPa, elt: 19% at ambient temperature.

Intrinisic second-phase particles in powder-processed MoSi2. MoSi2 has been
produced by hot pressing of commercial and in-house powders and also by arc
melting of pure molybdenum and silicon. It is shown that the glassy phase
observed in powder-processed MoSi2 consists of amorphous SiO2 and that formation
of this phase is intrinsic to powder processing. In addition, the Mo5Si3 phase,
which is often present in MoSi2 , is found to be a carbon-stabilized form of
approximate composition CMo5Si3 .

Controlling the Growth of CuParticles through Semibatch Process. In order to
produce monodispersed particles, two requirements are considered; they are a
complete separation of nucleation and growth steps for the formation of
particles and an avoidance of their aggregation during the nucleation and
growth. In this study, a new method was presented for preparing narrowly size
distributed copper powders from CuO slurry by wet chemical reduction with
hydrazine used as a reductant. The rapid nucleation was first induced by a very
fast reduction of Pd2+ resulted from batch process. Subsequently copper species
which contribute to the growth on the formed Pdo nuclei was slowly generated by
semibatch process. A complete separation between nucleation and growth therefore
was obtained, resulting in a narrow size distribution of final Cu powder
product. The effect parameters on the growth such as Pd2+ concentration and
temperature were also investigated.

FEM Optimization of a Steel Belt of OTR Tyres. This paper deals with an FEM
very important role in all radial tyres especially in case of heavy-duty off-
reinforcement. High peak stress inside this composite can initiate cracks, which
subsequently lead to a complete tyre failure. In this work, the belt is
extracted from the tyre and simulated separately in order to be able to cover
individual cords. Belt behaviour under tension is studied and optimal cord
distribution is proposed to decrease the risk of the failure. FEM software MSC
Marc/Mentat is employed as a calculation tool.

First order reaction kinetics for transient creep in NiAl hardened austenitic
temperature range of 823 to at stresses ranging from 150 to 450 MPa in the frame
work of first order reaction kinetics. The present analysis is aimed: to
correlate various transient creep parameters with steady state creep rate
following first order reaction rate theory to obtain correlation constants; and
to arrive at a unified equation to describe primary and steady state regimes of
the creep curves in terms of correlation coefficients thus derived. Good
correlation of transient creep parameters with steady state creep rate has been
obtained over the test conditions studied indicating that the basic mechanism of
deformation is the same for all the three stages of creep. Unified equation that
fits the experimental creep strain time data for different test conditions over
transient and steady state regimes has been obtained in terms of correlation
coefficients.

Preparation of SnO2TiO2/Zeolite YComposites with Enhanced Photocatalytic
Activity. SnO2 -TiO2 /zeolite Y composites were prepared by the impregnation of
tin chloride and tetrabutyl titanate solution with zeolite Y and subsequent
calcination at 500. SnO2 -TiO2 heterostructures coated on zeolite Y is
ascertained by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra characterization. The
photocatalytic studies suggested that the SnO2 -TiO2 /zeolite Y showed enhanced
photocatalytic efficiency of photodegradation of methyl orange compared with
TiO2 / zeolite Y and SnO2 /zeolite Y under UV light irradiation.

Heat and mass transfer during crystal growth. Quality of semiconductor and oxide
crystals which are grown from the melts plays an important role for electronic
and/or optical devices. The crystal quality is significantly affected by the
heat and mass transfer in the melts during crystal growth in a growth furnace
such as Czochralski or horizontal Bridgman methods. This paper reviews the
present understanding of phenomena of the heat and mass transfer of the melts,
especially instability of melt convection from the detailed numerical
calculation, which helps to understand the melt convection visualized using
X-ray radiography. Large scale simulation of melt convection during crystal
growth is also reviewed. Characteristics of flow instabilities of melt
convection with a low Prandtl number ratio between momentum and thermal
diffusivities are also reviewed by focusing on the instabilities of baroclinic,
the Rayleigh-Benard and the Marangoni-Benard, from the points of view of
temperature, rotating and/or magnetic field effects during crystal growth.
Oxygen concentration in grown crystals is also discussed how melt convection
affects.

A Systematic Study on Electronic and Thermodynamical Properties of Some LiM M=
Ag, Hg and TlIntermetallics. Binary intermetallic system, Li-M M=Ag, Hg and Tl
has been systematically evaluated and optimized using self consistent tight
binding linear muffin tin orbital TB-LMTO method under ambient conditions. The
lattice constant, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative were calculated. The
lattice constants were calculated to be 3.05, 3.20 and 3.34 A and bulk modulii
were predicted to be 61.8, 50 and 37.8 GPa, for LiAg, LiHg and LiTl,
respectively. Electronic band structures, partial and total densities of states
were derived in B2CsCl phase for the first time. The band structures show
metallic character and conductivity was mostly governed by Li-d and M-d states.
Furthermore, Debye temperature, Gruneisen constant and molar heat capacity in
terms of coefficients of the electronic and lattice heat capacities were
estimated.

Oxidation Behavior of a Pd43Cu27Ni10P20Bulk Metallic Glass and Foam in Dry Air.
The oxidation behavior of both Pd_43Cu_27Ni_10P_20 bulk metallic glass Pd4BMG
and its amorphous foam containing 45 pct porosity Pd4-AF was investigated over
the temperature range of 70 C to 350 C in dry air. The results showed that
virtually no oxidation occurred in the Pd4BMG at T < 250 C, revealing the alloys
favorable oxidation resistance in this temperature range. In addition, the
oxidation kinetics at T 250 C followed a parabolic-rate law, and the parabolic-
rate constants k_p values generally increased with temperature. It was found
that the oxidation k_p values of the Pd4-AF are slightly lower than those of the
Pd4BMG, indicating that the porous structure contributes to improving the
overall oxidation resistance. The scale formed on the alloys was composed
exclusively of CuO at T 275 C, whose thickness gradually increased with
increasing temperature. In addition, the amorphous structure remained unchanged
at T 275 C, while a triplex-phase structure developed after the oxidation at
higher temperatures, consisting of Pd_2Ni_2P, Cu_3P, and Pd_3P.

Doping effect of copper zinc tin sulphide counter electrode for dye-sensitized
solar cells. The exploration of more efficient counter electrode CE is of great
significance for the development of dye-sensitized solar cells Here, the
catalysis of I3 /I by Cu2ZnSnS4CZTS and its derivatives have been investigated
using density functional theory DFT. By studying the geometrical and electronic
properties of iodine atom adsorbed on CZTS, Cu2ZnSnS x Se4 x CZTSSe, and
Cu2ZnSnSe4CZTSe, it was found that the charge transport performance of CZTS can
be significantly enhanced when the S in CZTS was replaced by Se. Further
investigation on the different cation sites of CZTS doped with K, V, Ir, or Pt
reveals that the formation of V-substituted CZTS is energetically favorable.
Adsorption energies of iodine atom and desorption energies of iodine anion on
various surfaces were further calculated. The results indicated that the
designed material shows a high catalytic activity for the reaction of I3 /I when
the Cu2 atom in CZTS is replaced by VVCu2 . Thus, the findings could help to
promote novel, high-efficiency CZTS-based CE in

mechanical alloying MA. MA is an effective method to manufacture silicon-carbon
composite. The results show that the capacity retention ability of the graphite
doped silicon by MA anode is better than silicon. The fellow result shows that
Li a C b appears at the middle of lithiation process and disappear with the
production of Li x Si y , Li x Si y produce and disappears at the end of
lithiation process and beginning of delithiation process respectively. The SEI

Applicability of Recycling Materials to Cavity Filling Materials. There are many
abandoned lignite mines in the Tokai region of Japan. They are now being filled
with materials because of the possibility of caving and collapsing or subsidence
in urbanized areas above these abandoned mines. The filling material is
initially in a slurry state and it solidifies with time after filling the
cavities. The main material of slurry is by-products produced at a neighboring
macadam factory. The utilization of by-products as filling materials could not
be done until now due to the restrictions of some regulations. There are two
purposes of this research. The first purpose is to examine the suitability of
various recycling materials as filling materials all over Japan. The second
purpose is to develop new cavity filling materials from recycling materials. It
is experimentally confirmed that some of by-products can be successfully
utilized as cavity filling materials.

A cost-effective approach for rapid manufacturing a low pressure wax injection
mold with high surface finish and high dimensional accuracy. Investment casting
process is considered as an economic method for mass production of metal parts.
Improvement of mold surface quality and geometric accuracy in the fused
deposition rapid tooling is a major concern. In this paper, a new technique is
proposed for rapid manufacturing a low pressure wax injection mold with high
surface finish and high dimensional accuracy. Wax patterns produced from this
mold have not only better dimensional accuracy but also better surface finish.
The average relative error of dimension of wax patterns can be reduced from
1.76% to 0.66%. Surface roughness improvement rate of wax patterns of up to
85.71% can be achieved. Advantages of this technique include low manufacturing
cost, simple manufacturing process and flexible process capability.

Biocorrosion behavior of biodegradable nanocomposite fibers coated layer-by-
layer on AM50 magnesium implant. This article demonstrates the use of hybrid
nanofibers to improve the biodegradation rate and biocompatibility of AM50
magnesium alloy. Biodegradable hybrid membrane fiber layers containing nano-
hydroxyapatite nHA particles and polylactidePLA nanofibers were coated layer-by-
layer LbL on AM50 coupons using a facile single-step air jet spinning AJS
approach. The corrosion performance of coated and uncoated coupon samples was
investigated by means of electrochemical measurements. The results showed that
the AJS 3D membrane fiber layers, particularly the hybrid membrane layers
containing a small amount of nHA 3 wt.%, induce a higher biocorrosion resistance
and effectively decrease the initial degradation rate compared with the neat
AM50 coupon samples. The adhesion strength improved highly due to the presence
of nHA particles in the AJS layer. Furthermore, the long biodegradation rates of
AM50 alloy in Hank's balanced salt solution HBSS were significantly controlled
by the AJS-coatings. The results showed a higher cytocompatibility for AJS-
coatings compared to that for neat Mg alloys. The nanostructured nHA embedded
hybrid PLA nanofiber coating can therefore be a suitable coating material for Mg
alloy as a potential material for biodegradable metallic orthopedic implants.
