## Filtering

- [x] Filter out works (no title, no abstract, retracted, paratext)
- [ ] Filter out abstracts: len < 30 and len > 1000 (=> get distribution first)
- [ ] Filter out other languages (pt, de, fr)
- [ ] Detect latex commands
- [ ] Filter out works with low/no relation to'materials science' (use concepts)
- [ ] Filter out bullshit abstracts (e.g. only contact information "phone number", "email")
- [ ] Perform tiny data analysis on filtered data: how many with other languages, how many with latex commands, how many with no relation -> manually identify bad journal papers
